<p>General Physics is organized such that topics are introduced conceptually with a steady progression to precise
    definitions and analytical applications. The analytical aspect (problem solving) is tied back to the conceptual

    relevant to the subject of the chapter and interesting applications that are easy for most students to
    visualize.</p>

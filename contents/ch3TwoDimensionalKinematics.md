![In this figure the Dragon Khan rollercoaster in Spain&#x2019;s Universal Port Aventura Amusement Park is shown. There are mostly curved paths in the rollercoaster. Near to the rollercoaster there is the track of rollercoaster cart under a bridge. There are some trees near the track.](/resources/Figure_03_00_01a.jpg "Everyday motion that we experience is, thankfully, rarely as tortuous as a rollercoaster ride like this&#x2014;the Dragon Khan in Spain&#x2019;s Universal Port Aventura Amusement Park. However, most motion is in curved, rather than straight-line, paths. Motion along a curved path is two- or three-dimensional motion, and can be described in a similar fashion to one-dimensional motion. (credit: Boris23/Wikimedia Commons)")

The arc of a basketball, the orbit of a satellite, a bicycle rounding a curve, a
swimmer diving into a pool, blood gushing out of a wound, and a puppy chasing
its tail are but a few examples of motions along curved paths. In fact, most
motions in nature follow curved paths rather than straight lines. Motion along a
curved path on a flat surface or a plane (such as that of a ball on a pool table
or a skater on an ice rink) is two-dimensional, and thus described by
two-dimensional kinematics. Motion not confined to a plane, such as a car
following a winding mountain road, is described by three-dimensional kinematics.
Both two- and three-dimensional kinematics are simple extensions of the
one-dimensional kinematics developed for straight-line motion in the previous
chapter. This simple extension will allow us to apply physics to many more
situations, and it will also yield unexpected insights about nature.

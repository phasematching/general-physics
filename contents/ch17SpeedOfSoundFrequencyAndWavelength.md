{: #Figure1}

Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of
frequency and wavelength. You can observe direct evidence of the speed of sound
while watching a fireworks display. The flash of an explosion is seen well
before its sound is heard, implying both that sound travels at a finite speed
and that it is much slower than light. You can also directly sense the frequency
of a sound. Perception of frequency is called **pitch**. The wavelength of sound
is not directly sensed, but indirect evidence is found in the correlation of the
size of musical instruments with their pitch. Small instruments, such as a
piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while large instruments, such as a
tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High pitch means small wavelength, and
the size of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound
it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds. Similar
arguments hold that a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.

The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the
same as for all waves:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda , $$
</div>

where $${v}_{w} $$ is the speed of sound, $$f $$ is its frequency, and $$\lambda
$$ is its wavelength. The wavelength of a sound is the distance between adjacent
identical parts of a wave—for example, between adjacent compressions as
illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). The frequency is the same as that of the
source and is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

![A picture of a vibrating tuning fork is shown. The sound wave compressions and rarefactions are shown to emanate from the fork on both the sides as semicircular arcs of alternate bold and dotted lines. The wavelength is marked as the distance between two successive bold arcs. The frequency of the vibrations is shown as f and velocity of the wave represented by v sub w.](../resources/Figure_18_02_02a.jpg "A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency \( f \), propagates at \( v_w \) , and has a wavelength \( \lambda \).")
{: #Figure2}

[[Table 1]](#Table1) makes it apparent that the speed of sound varies greatly in
different media. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination
of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more
rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. This
observation is analogous to the fact that the frequency of a simple harmonic
motion is directly proportional to the stiffness of the oscillating object. The
greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. This observation
is analogous to the fact that the frequency of a simple harmonic motion is
inversely proportional to the mass of the oscillating object. The speed of sound
in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are
relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such
media is generally greater than in gases.

Earthquakes, essentially sound waves in Earth’s crust, are an interesting
example of how the speed of sound depends on the rigidity of the medium.
Earthquakes have both longitudinal and transverse components, and these travel
at different speeds. The bulk modulus of granite is greater than its shear
modulus. For that reason, the speed of longitudinal or pressure waves (P-waves)
in earthquakes in granite is significantly higher than the speed of transverse
or shear waves (S-waves). Both components of earthquakes travel slower in less
rigid material, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and
S-waves correspondingly range in speed from 2 to 5 km/s, both being faster in
more rigid material. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave
as they travel through Earth’s crust. The time between the P- and S-waves is
routinely used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the
earthquake.

The speed of sound is affected by temperature in a given medium. For air at sea
level, the speed of sound is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}}, $$
</div>

where the temperature (denoted as $$T $$ )
is in units of kelvin. The speed of sound in gases is related to the average
speed of particles in the gas, $${v}_{\text{rms}} $$ , and that

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}, $$
</div>

where $$k_{B} $$ is the Boltzmann constant ( $$1.38 \times 10^{\text{−23}}
\text{J/K} $$ )
and $$m $$ is the mass of each (identical) particle in the gas. So, it is
reasonable that the speed of sound in air and other gases should depend on the
square root of temperature. While not negligible, this is not a strong
dependence. At $$0 \text{ºC} $$ , the speed of sound is 331 m/s, whereas at
$$20.0 \text{ºC} $$ it is 343 m/s, less than a 4%
increase. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a use of the speed of sound by a bat to
sense distances. Echoes are also used in medical imaging.

![The picture is of a bat trying to catch its prey an insect using sound echoes. The incident sound and sound reflected from the bat are shown as semicircular arcs.](../resources/Figure_18_02_03a.jpg "A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the distance.")
{: #Figure3}

One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly
independent of frequency. This independence is certainly true in open air for
sounds in the audible range of 20 to 20 000 Hz. If this independence were not
true, you would certainly notice it for music played by a marching band in a
football stadium, for example. Suppose that high-frequency sounds traveled
faster—then the farther you were from the band, the more the sound from the
low-pitch instruments would lag that from the high-pitch ones. But the music
from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all
frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed. Recall that

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda . $$
</div>

In a given medium under fixed conditions, $${v}_{\text{w}} $$ is constant, so
that there is a relationship between $$f $$ and $$\lambda $$ ; the higher the
frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4) and consider
the following example.

![Picture of a speaker having a woofer and a tweeter. High frequency sound coming out of the woofer shown as small circles closely spaced. Low frequency sound coming out of tweeter are shown as larger circles distantly spaced.](../resources/Figure_18_02_04a.jpg "Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter.")

Calculating Wavelengths: What Are the Wavelengths of Audible Sounds?
</div>
Calculate the wavelengths of sounds at the extremes of the audible range, 20 and 20 000 Hz, in  $$30.0 \text{ºC} $$
 air. (Assume that the frequency values are accurate to two significant figures.)

**Strategy**

To find wavelength from frequency, we can use $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda $$.

**Solution**

1. Identify knowns. The value for $${v}_{\text{w}} $$ , is given by
   <div class="equation" >
   $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}}. $$
   </div>

2. Convert the temperature into kelvin and then enter the temperature into the
   equation
   <div class="equation" >
   $${v}_{\text{w}}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{303 \text{K}}{273 \text{K}}}= 348.7 \text{m/s}. $$
   </div>

3. Solve the relationship between speed and wavelength for $$\lambda $$ \:
   <div class="equation" >
     $$\lambda =\frac{ {v}_{w}}{f}. $$
   </div>

4. Enter the speed and the minimum frequency to give the maximum wavelength:
   <div class="equation" >
     $${\lambda }_{\text{max}}=\frac{ 348.7 \text{m/s}}{20 \text{Hz}}=17 \text{m}. $$
   </div>

5. Enter the speed and the maximum frequency to give the minimum wavelength:
   <div class="equation" >
     $${\lambda }_{\text{min}}=\frac{ 348.7 \text{m/s}}{20\text{,}000 \text{Hz}}= 0.017 \text{m}=1.7 \text{cm}. $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

Because the product of $$f $$ multiplied by $$\lambda $$ equals a constant, the
smaller $$f $$ is, the larger $$\lambda $$ must be, and vice versa.

</div>

The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another.
However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven
oscillation and has the frequency of the original source. If $${v}_{\text{w}} $$
changes and $$f $$ remains the same, then the wavelength $$\lambda $$ must
change. That is, because $${v}_{\text{w}}=f\lambda $$ , the higher the speed of
a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

Sound and light both travel at definite speeds. The speed of sound is slower than the speed of light. The first firework is probably very close by, so the speed difference is not noticeable.

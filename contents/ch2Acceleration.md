In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The accelerator in a
car can in fact cause it to speed up. The greater the **acceleration**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id1298945} , the greater the change in velocity
over a given time. The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with
these notions, but more inclusive.

<div data-type="title">
Average Acceleration
</div>

**Average Acceleration**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2580108} is *the rate at which velocity changes*,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id4040806">
 $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{ v_{f}-v_{0}}{ t_{f}-t_{0}}, $$
</div>
where $$ \overline{a} $$ is average acceleration, $$ v $$ is velocity, and $$ t $$
 is time. (The bar over the $$ a $$ means *average* acceleration.)

</div>

Because acceleration is velocity in m/s divided by time in s, the SI units for
acceleration are $$ \mss $$, meters per second squared or meters per
second per second, which literally means by how many meters per second the
velocity changes every second.

Recall that velocity is a vector—it has both magnitude and direction. This means
that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can
also be a change in *direction*. For example, if a car turns a corner at
constant speed, it is accelerating because its direction is changing. The
quicker you turn, the greater the acceleration. So there is an acceleration when
velocity changes either in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed)
or in direction, or both.

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Acceleration as a Vector
</div>
Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the *change* in velocity, $$ \Delta v $$.
Since velocity is a vector, it can change either in magnitude or in direction.
Acceleration is therefore a change in either speed or direction, or both.

</div>

Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the *change* in
velocity, it is not always in the direction of *motion*. When an object slows
down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. This is known
as **deceleration**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3583719}.

Misconception Alert: Deceleration vs. Negative Acceleration
</div>
Deceleration always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the
direction of the velocity. Deceleration always reduces speed. Negative acceleration,
however, is acceleration *in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate
system*. Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleration, and deceleration
may or may not be considered negative acceleration. For example,
consider [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3579626).

Calculating Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate
</div>
A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of 15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its average acceleration?

![Two racehorses running toward the left.](../resources/racehorse.jpg "(credit: Jon Sullivan, PD Photo.org)")

{: #import-auto-id1806246}

**Strategy**

First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem. This is a
simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice that we assign east
as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have negative velocity.

![An acceleration vector arrow pointing west, in the negative x direction, labeled with a equals question mark. A velocity vector arrow also pointing toward the left, with initial velocity labeled as 0 and final velocity labeled as negative fifteen point 0 meters per second.](../resources/Figure_02_03_01a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1464243}

We can solve this problem by identifying $$ \Delta v $$ and $$ \Delta t $$ from
the given information and then calculating the average acceleration directly
from the equation $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{ v_{f}-v_{0}}{
t_{f}-t_{0}} $$.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ v_{0}=0 $$, $$ v_{f}=-15.0 \ms $$
(the negative sign indicates direction toward the west), $$ \Delta t=1\text{.80
s} $$.

2\. Find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to $$ -15.0
 \ms $$, its change in velocity equals its final velocity: $$ \Delta v=v_
{f}=-15.0 \ms $$.

3\. Plug in the known values ( $$ \Delta v $$ and $$ \Delta t $$)
and solve for the unknown $$ \overline{a} $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2400983">
 $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{-15.0 \ms }{1.80 \s }=-8.33 \mss . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the
west. An acceleration of $$ 8.33 \mss $$ due west means that the horse
increases its velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each second, that is, 8.33 meters
per second per second, which we write as $$ 8.33 \mss $$. This is
truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We shall see
later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on
with a force nearly equal to his weight.

</div>

### Instantaneous Acceleration

**Instantaneous acceleration**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2303194} $$ a
$$, or the *acceleration at a specific instant in time*, is obtained by the same
process as discussed for instantaneous velocity
in [Time, Velocity, and Speed](/contents/ch2TimeVelocityAndSpeed.md)—that is, by considering an
infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous
acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average
acceleration that is representative of the
motion. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590846) shows graphs of instantaneous
acceleration versus time for two very different motions.
In [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590846)(a), the acceleration varies slightly and
the average over the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous
acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this motion as if it had
a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about $$ 1.8
\mss $$).
 In [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590846)(b), the acceleration varies drastically
over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and
choose an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion
over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate
motions with accelerations of $$ +3.0 \mss $$ and $$ -2.0
\mss $$, respectively.

![Line graphs of instantaneous acceleration in meters per second per second versus time in seconds. The line on graph (a) shows slight variation above and below an average acceleration of about 1 point 8 meters per second per second. The line on graph (b) shows great variation over time, with instantaneous acceleration constant at 3 point 0 meters per second per second for 1 second, then dropping to negative 2 point 0 meters per second per second for the next 2 seconds, and then rising again, and so forth.](../resources/Figure_02_03_02.jpg "Graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two different one-dimensional motions. (a) Here acceleration varies only slightly and is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time. (b) Here the acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated forward and backward as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or nearly constant acceleration in such a situation.")

the reasoning that goes into solving problems.

kilometers to a final position of 3 point

Calculating Displacement: A Subway Train
</div>
What are the magnitude and sign of displacements for the motions of the subway train shown in parts (a) and (b) of [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590556)?

**Strategy**

A drawing with a coordinate system is already provided, so we don’t need to make
a sketch, but we should analyze it to make sure we understand what it is
showing. Pay particular attention to the coordinate system. To find
displacement, we use the equation $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0} $$. This is
straightforward since the initial and final positions are given.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. In the figure we see that $$ x_{f}=6.70 \text{km} $$
and $$ x_{0}=4.70 \text{km} $$ for part (a), and $$ x^{\prime}_{f}=3.75
\text{km} $$ and $$ x^{\prime}_{0}=5.25 \text{km} $$ for part (b).

2\. Solve for displacement in part (a).

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2400875">
 $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0}=6.70 \text{km}-4.70 \text{km}=+2.00 \text{km} $$
</div>
3\. Solve for displacement in part (b).

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2589758">
 $$ \Delta x^{\prime} =x^{\prime}_{f}-x^{\prime}_{0}=3.75 \text{km}-5.25 \text{km}=-1.50 \text{km} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The direction of the motion in (a) is to the right and therefore its
displacement has a positive sign, whereas motion in (b) is to the left and thus
has a negative sign.

Comparing Distance Traveled with Displacement: A Subway Train
</div>
What are the distances traveled for the motions shown in parts (a) and (b) of the subway train in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590556)?

**Strategy**

To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and distance
traveled, and how they are related to displacement. Distance between two
positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement, which was found
in [\[link\]](#fs-id1744930). Distance traveled is the total length of the path
traveled between the two positions. (
See [Displacement](/contents/ch2Displacement.md).) In the case of the subway train shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590556), the distance traveled is the same as the
distance between the initial and final positions of the train.

**Solution**

1\. The displacement for part (a) was +2.00 km. Therefore, the distance between
the initial and final positions was 2.00 km, and the distance traveled was 2.00
km.

2\. The displacement for part (b) was $$ −1.5 \text{km.} $$ Therefore, the
distance between the initial and final positions was 1.50 km, and the distance
traveled was 1.50 km.

**Discussion**

Distance is a scalar. It has magnitude but no sign to indicate direction.

Calculating Acceleration: A Subway Train Speeding Up
</div>
Suppose the train in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590556)(a) accelerates from rest to 30.0 km/h in the first 20.0 s of its motion. What is its average acceleration during that time interval?

**Strategy**

It is worth it at this point to make a simple sketch:

![A point represents the initial velocity of 0 kilometers per second. Below the point is a velocity vector arrow pointing to the right, representing the final velocity of thirty point zero kilometers per hour. Below the velocity vector is an acceleration vector arrow labeled a equals question mark.](../resources/Figure_02_03_03c.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id2400753}

This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in
velocity, then we must determine the change in time, and finally we use these
values to calculate the acceleration.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ v_{0}=0 $$
(the trains starts at rest), $$ v_{f}=30.0 \text{km/h} $$, and $$ \Delta t=20.0
\s $$.

2\. Calculate $$ \Delta v $$. Since the train starts from rest, its change in
velocity is $$ \Delta v=+30.0 \text{km/h} $$, where the plus sign means velocity
to the right.

3\. Plug in known values and solve for the unknown, $$ \overline{a} $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2412947">
 $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{+30.0 \text{km/h}}{20.0 s} $$
</div>
4\. Since the units are mixed (we have both hours and seconds for time), we need to convert everything into SI units of meters and seconds. (See [Physical Quantities and Units](/contents/m42091.md) for more guidance.)

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2297812">
 $$ \overline{a}=\left(\frac{+30 \text{km/h}}{20.0 \s }\right)\left(\frac{ 10^{3}\m }{1 \text{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1 \text{h}}{3600 \s }\right)=0.417 \mss $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable
because the train starts from rest and ends up with a velocity to the right (
also positive). So acceleration is in the same direction as the *change* in
velocity, as is always the case.

Calculate Acceleration: A Subway Train Slowing Down
</div>
Now suppose that at the end of its trip, the train in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2590556)(a) slows to a stop from a speed of 30.0 km/h in 8.00 s. What is its average acceleration while stopping?

**Strategy**

In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because
it is toward the left. As in the previous example, we must find the change in
velocity and the change in time and then solve for acceleration.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ v_{0}=30.0 \text{km/h} $$, $$ v_{f}=0 \text{km/h} $$
(the train is stopped, so its velocity is 0), and $$ \Delta t=8.00 \s $$.

2\. Solve for the change in velocity, $$ \Delta v $$.

 $$ \Delta v=v_{f}-v_{0}=0-30.0 \text{km/h}=-30.0 \text{km/h} $$
</div>
3\. Plug in the knowns, $$ \Delta v $$ and $$ \Delta t $$, and solve for $$ \overline{a} $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2412874">
 $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{-30.0 \text{km/h}}{8.00 \s } $$
</div>
4\. Convert the units to meters and seconds.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2596926">
 $$ \overline{a}=\frac{ \Delta v}{\Delta t}=\left(\frac{-30.0 \text{km/h}}{8.00 \s }\right)\left(\frac{ 10^{3}\m }{1 \text{km}}\right)\left(\frac{1 \text{h}}{3600 \s }\right)
=−1.04 \mss . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is
reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this problem,
and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again, acceleration is in
the same direction as the *change* in velocity, which is negative here. This
acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to
the velocity.

As before, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time to

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ v_{0}=-20 \text{km/h} $$, $$ v_{f}=0 \text{km/h} $$, $$
\Delta t=10.0 s $$.

2\. Calculate $$ \Delta v $$. The change in velocity here is actually positive,

**Discussion**

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable
because the train initially has a negative velocity (to the left) in this
problem and a positive acceleration opposes the motion (and so it is to the
right). Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the *change* in
velocity, which is positive here. As in [\[link\]](#fs-id3600466), this
acceleration can be called a deceleration since it is in the direction opposite
to the velocity.

</div>

### Sign and Direction

Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the signs of
the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the quantity is to the
right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy to imagine for
displacement and velocity. But it is a little less obvious for acceleration.
Most people interpret negative acceleration as the slowing of an object. This
was not the case in [\[link\]](#fs-id4015260), where a positive acceleration
slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration
was in the opposite direction from the velocity. In fact, a negative
acceleration will *increase* a negative velocity. For example, the train moving
to the left in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2412190) is sped up by an acceleration
to the left. In that case, both $$ v $$ and $$ a $$ are negative. The plus and
minus signs give the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the
same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up. If acceleration has the
opposite sign as the velocity, the object is slowing down.

* {: #import-auto-id2412758} Acceleration is a vector, and thus has a both a
  magnitude and direction.
* {: #import-auto-id2412770} Acceleration can be caused by either a change in
  the magnitude or the direction of the velocity.
* {: #import-auto-id2412772} Instantaneous acceleration $$ a $$ is the
  acceleration at a specific instant in time.
* {: #import-auto-id2412729} Deceleration is an acceleration with a direction
  opposite to that of the velocity.

**Professional Application**

Dr. John Paul Stapp was U.S. Air Force officer who studied the effects of
extreme deceleration on the human body. On December 10, 1954, Stapp rode a
rocket sled, accelerating from rest to a top speed of 282 m/s (1015 km/h) in
5.00 s, and was brought jarringly back to rest in only 1.40 s! Calculate his (a)
acceleration and (b) deceleration. Express each in multiples of $$ g $$, $$
\left(9.80 \mss \right) $$ by taking its ratio to the acceleration of
gravity.

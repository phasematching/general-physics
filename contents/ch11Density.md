Which weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks? This old riddle plays
with the distinction between mass and density. A ton is a ton, of course; but
bricks have much greater density than feathers, and so we are tempted to think
of them as heavier. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

**Density**, as you will see, is an important characteristic of substances. It
is crucial, for example, in determining whether an object sinks or floats in a
fluid. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance or object. In equation
form, density is defined as

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}, $$
</div>

where the Greek letter $$\rho $$
(rho) is the symbol for density, $$m $$ is the mass, and $$V $$ is the volume
occupied by the substance.

Density
</div>
Density is mass per unit volume.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}, $$
</div>
where  $$\rho  $$
 is the symbol for density,  $$m $$  is the mass, and  $$V $$
 is the volume occupied by the substance.

</div>

In the riddle regarding the feathers and bricks, the masses are the same, but
the volume occupied by the feathers is much greater, since their density is much
lower. The SI unit of density is $${\text{kg/m} }^{3} $$ , representative values
are given in [[Table 1]](#Table1). The metric system was originally devised
so that water would have a density of $$1 {\text{g/cm} }^{3} $$ , equivalent to
$$10^{3} {\text{kg/m} }^{3} $$ . Thus the basic mass unit, the kilogram, was
first devised to be the mass of 1000 mL of water, which has a volume of 1000
cm<sup>3</sup>.

As you can see by examining [[Table 1]](#Table1), the density of an object
may help identify its composition. The density of gold, for example, is about
2.5 times the density of iron, which is about 2.5 times the density of aluminum.
Density also reveals something about the phase of the matter and its
substructure. Notice that the densities of liquids and solids are roughly
comparable, consistent with the fact that their atoms are in close contact. The
densities of gases are much less than those of liquids and solids, because the
atoms in gases are separated by large amounts of empty space.

If the volumes of both piles are the same, any difference in mass is due to their different densities (including the air space between crystals). Which do you think has the greater density?

Calculating the Mass of a Reservoir From Its Volume
</div>
A reservoir has a surface area of  $$ 50.0 {\text{km}}^{2} $$
 and an average depth of 40.0 m. What mass of water is held behind the dam? (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) for a view of a large reservoir—the Three Gorges Dam site on the Yangtze River in central China.)

<strong>Strategy </strong>

We can calculate the volume $$V $$ of the reservoir from its dimensions, and
find the density of water $$\rho $$ in [[Table 1]](#Table1). Then the mass
$$m $$ can be found from the definition of density

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}. $$
</div>
**Solution**

Solving equation $$\rho =m/V $$ for $$m $$ gives $$m=\rho V $$.

The volume $$V $$ of the reservoir is its surface area $$A $$ times its average
depth $$h $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}V& =& Ah=\left(50.0 {\text{km}}^{2}\right)\left(40.0 \text{m}\right)\\ & =& \left[ \left(50.0 \text{k}{\text{m}}^{2}\right){\left(\frac{ 10^{3} \text{m}}{1 \text{km}}\right)}^{2}\right]  \left(40.0 \text{m}\right)= 2.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{m}}^{3}\end{array} $$
</div>
The density of water  $$\rho  $$
 from [[Table 1]](#Table1) is  $$ 1.000 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ .
 Substituting  $$V $$
 and  $$\rho  $$  into the expression for mass gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}m& =& \left( 1.00 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 2.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{m}}^{3}\right)\\ & =&  2.00 \times 10^{12}  \text{kg} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A large reservoir contains a very large mass of water. In this example, the
weight of the water in the reservoir is $$mg= 1.96 \times 10^{13} \text{N} $$ ,
where $$g $$ is the acceleration due to the Earth’s gravity (about $$ 9.80
{\text{m/s}}^{2} $$ ). It is reasonable to ask whether the dam must supply a
force equal to this tremendous weight. The answer is no. As we shall see in the
following sections, the force the dam must supply can be much smaller than the
weight of the water it holds back.

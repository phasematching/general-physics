### Diffusion

There is something fishy about the ice cube from your freezer—how did it pick up
those food odors? How does soaking a sprained ankle in Epsom salt reduce
swelling? The answer to these questions are related to atomic and molecular
transport phenomena—another mode of fluid motion. Atoms and molecules are in
constant motion at any temperature. In fluids they move about randomly even in
the absence of macroscopic flow. This motion is called a random walk and is
illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). **Diffusion** is the movement of
substances due to random thermal molecular motion. Fluids, like fish fumes or
odors entering ice cubes, can even diffuse through solids.

Diffusion is a slow process over macroscopic distances. The densities of common
materials are great enough that molecules cannot travel very far before having a
collision that can scatter them in any direction, including straight backward.
It can be shown that the average distance $${x}_{\text{rms}} $$ that a molecule
travels is proportional to the square root of time:

<div class="equation" >
 $${x}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{2 Dt}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $${x}_{\text{rms}} $$ stands for the **root-mean-square distance** and is
the statistical average for the process. The quantity $$D $$ is the diffusion
constant for the particular molecule in a specific medium. [[Table 1]](#Table1)
lists representative values of $$D $$ for various substances, in units of
$${\text{m}}^{2}\text{/s} $$.

![The figure shows the path of a random walk. The random thermal motion of a molecule is shown to begin at a start point and then the particles move about zigzag in all directions and end up at the finish point. The distance between the start and finish point is shown as x. Continuous arrows show various directions of motion.](../resources/Figure_13_07_01a.jpg "The random thermal motion of a molecule in a fluid in time \( t \) . This type of motion is called a random walk.")

Note that $$D $$ gets progressively smaller for more massive molecules. This
decrease is because the average molecular speed at a given temperature is
inversely proportional to molecular mass. Thus the more massive molecules
diffuse more slowly. Another interesting point is that $$D $$ for oxygen in air
is much greater than $$D $$ for oxygen in water. In water, an oxygen molecule
makes many more collisions in its random walk and is slowed considerably. In
water, an oxygen molecule moves only about $$40 \mu \text{m} $$ in 1 s. (Each
molecule actually collides about $$ 10^{10} $$ times per second!). Finally, note
that diffusion constants increase with temperature, because average molecular
speed increases with temperature. This is because the average kinetic energy of
molecules, $$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ , is proportional to absolute temperature.

Calculating Diffusion: How Long Does Glucose Diffusion Take?
</div>
Calculate the average time it takes a glucose molecule to move 1.0 cm in water.

**Strategy**

We can use $${x}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{2Dt} $$ , the expression for the average
distance moved in time $$t $$ , and solve it for $$t $$ . All other quantities
are known.

**Solution**

Solving for $$t $$ and substituting known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}t& =& \frac{ {x}_{\text{rms}}^{2}}{2D}=\frac{ {\left(0.010 \text{m} \right)}^{2}}{2\left( 6.7 \times 10^{-10} {\text{m}}^{2}\text{/s}\right)}\\ & =&  7.5 \times 10^{4}  \text{s}=21 \text{h}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is a remarkably long time for glucose to move a mere centimeter! For this
reason, we stir sugar into water rather than waiting for it to diffuse.

</div>

Because diffusion is typically very slow, its most important effects occur over
small distances. For example, the cornea of the eye gets most of its oxygen by
diffusion through the thin tear layer covering it.

### The Rate and Direction of Diffusion

If you very carefully place a drop of food coloring in a still glass of water,
it will slowly diffuse into the colorless surroundings until its concentration
is the same everywhere. This type of diffusion is called free diffusion, because
there are no barriers inhibiting it. Let us examine its direction and rate.
Molecular motion is random in direction, and so simple chance dictates that more
molecules will move out of a region of high concentration than into it. The net
rate of diffusion is higher initially than after the process is partially
completed. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).)

![The figure shows the diffusion along a cylindrical tube of area of cross section A. The cylindrical tube is divided into three regions. The cross section is marked as A. The first region is marked as region one. The concentration there is marked C one. The molecules are shown as small sphere with an arrow pointing out from them. The concentration is high in this region. The second region is marked of width delta x. The concentration is lesser in this region as compared to region one. The third region is marked as region two, the concentration in this region lesser than the other two regions shown by lesser number of spherical molecules.](../resources/Figure_13_07_02a.jpg "Diffusion proceeds from a region of higher concentration to a lower one. The net rate of movement is proportional to the difference in concentration.")
{: #Figure2}

The net rate of diffusion is proportional to the concentration difference. Many
more molecules will leave a region of high concentration than will enter it from
a region of low concentration. In fact, if the concentrations were the same,
there would be <em> no</em> net movement. The net rate of diffusion is also
proportional to the diffusion constant $$D $$ , which is determined
experimentally. The farther a molecule can diffuse in a given time, the more
likely it is to leave the region of high concentration. Many of the factors that
affect the rate are hidden in the diffusion constant $$D $$ . For example,
temperature and cohesive and adhesive forces all affect values of $$D $$.

Diffusion is the dominant mechanism by which the exchange of nutrients and waste
products occur between the blood and tissue, and between air and blood in the
lungs. In the evolutionary process, as organisms became larger, they needed
quicker methods of transportation than net diffusion, because of the larger
distances involved in the transport, leading to the development of circulatory
systems. Less sophisticated, single-celled organisms still rely totally on
diffusion for the removal of waste products and the uptake of nutrients.

### Osmosis and Dialysis—Diffusion across Membranes

Some of the most interesting examples of diffusion occur through barriers that
affect the rates of diffusion. For example, when you soak a swollen ankle in
Epsom salt, water diffuses through your skin. Many substances regularly move
through cell membranes; oxygen moves in, carbon dioxide moves out, nutrients go
in, and wastes go out, for example. Because membranes are thin structures (
typically $$ 6.5 \times 10^{-9} $$ to $$10 \times 10^{-9} $$ m across) diffusion
rates through them can be high. Diffusion through membranes is an important
method of transport.

Membranes are generally selectively permeable, or **semipermeable**. (
See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) One type of semipermeable membrane has small pores
that allow only small molecules to pass through. In other types of membranes,
the molecules may actually dissolve in the membrane or react with molecules in
the membrane while moving across. Membrane function, in fact, is the subject of
much current research, involving not only physiology but also chemistry and
physics.

![Part a of the figure shows a semi permeable membrane shown as small rectangular sections in a vertical line, separated by small gaps called as pores. Molecules are shown in all shapes on both the sides of the membranes. Some molecules are shown to diffuse through the pores. Part b of the diagram shows molecules in the form of small spheres packed on both sides of a single vertical rectangular membrane. Some molecules are shown to dissolve in this membrane and diffuse across it.](../resources/Figure_13_07_03a.jpg "(a) A semipermeable membrane with small pores that allow only small molecules to pass through. (b) Certain molecules dissolve in this membrane and diffuse across it.")
{: #Figure3}

**Osmosis** is the transport of water through a semipermeable membrane from a
region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Osmosis is driven
by the imbalance in water concentration. For example, water is more concentrated
in your body than in Epsom salt. When you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt,
the water moves out of your body into the lower-concentration region in the
salt. Similarly, **dialysis** is the transport of any other molecule through a
semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference. Both osmosis and
dialysis are used by the kidneys to cleanse the blood.

Osmosis can create a substantial pressure. Consider what happens if osmosis
continues for some time, as illustrated in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). Water moves
by osmosis from the left into the region on the right, where it is less
concentrated, causing the solution on the right to rise. This movement will
continue until the pressure $$\rho gh $$ created by the extra height of fluid on
the right is large enough to stop further osmosis. This pressure is called a *
back pressure*. The back pressure $$\rho gh $$ that stops osmosis is also called
the **relative osmotic pressure** if neither solution is pure water, and it is
called the **osmotic pressure** if one solution is pure water. Osmotic pressure
can be large, depending on the size of the concentration difference. For
example, if pure water and sea water are separated by a semipermeable membrane
that passes no salt, osmotic pressure will be 25.9 atm. This value means that
water will diffuse through the membrane until the salt water surface rises 268 m
above the pure-water surface! One example of pressure created by osmosis is
turgor in plants (many wilt when too dry). Turgor describes the condition of a
plant in which the fluid in a cell exerts a pressure against the cell wall. This
pressure gives the plant support. Dialysis can similarly cause substantial
pressures.

![Part a of the figure shows a vessel having two different concentrations of sugar in water separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes water but not sugar molecules. The sugar molecules are shown as small red color spheres and water molecules as still smaller blue colored spheres. The right side of the solution shows more of sugar molecules represented as more number of red spheres. The osmosis of water molecules is shown toward right. Part b shows the second stage for figure on part a. The osmosis of water is shown toward right. The height of fluid on right is shown as h above the fluid on the left. The back pressure of water is shown toward left.](../resources/Figure_13_07_04a.jpg "(a) Two sugar-water solutions of different concentrations, separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes water but not sugar. Osmosis will be to the right, since water is less concentrated there. (b) The fluid level rises until the back pressure \( \rho gh \) equals the relative osmotic pressure; then, the net transfer of water is zero.")
{: #Figure4}

**Reverse osmosis** and **reverse dialysis** (also called filtration) are
processes that occur when back pressure is sufficient to reverse the normal
direction of substances through membranes. Back pressure can be created
naturally as on the right side of [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). (A piston can also
create this pressure.) Reverse osmosis can be used to desalinate water by simply
forcing it through a membrane that will not pass salt. Similarly, reverse
dialysis can be used to filter out any substance that a given membrane will not
pass.

One further example of the movement of substances through membranes deserves
mention. We sometimes find that substances pass in the direction opposite to
what we expect. Cypress tree roots, for example, extract pure water from salt
water, although osmosis would move it in the opposite direction. This is not
reverse osmosis, because there is no back pressure to cause it. What is
happening is called **active transport**, a process in which a living membrane
expends energy to move substances across it. Many living membranes move water
and other substances by active transport. The kidneys, for example, not only use
osmosis and dialysis—they also employ significant active transport to move
substances into and out of blood. In fact, it is estimated that at least 25% of
the body’s energy is expended on active transport of substances at the cellular
level. The study of active transport carries us into the realms of microbiology,
biophysics, and biochemistry and it is a fascinating application of the laws of
nature to living structures.

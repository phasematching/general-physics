</div>

We can get a good understanding of **electromagnetic waves** (EM) by considering
how they are produced. Whenever a current varies, associated electric and
magnetic fields vary, moving out from the source like waves. Perhaps the easiest
situation to visualize is a varying current in a long straight wire, produced by
an AC generator at its center, as illustrated in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

![A long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center, functioning as a broadcast antenna for electromagnetic waves, is shown. The wave distributions at four different times are shown in four different parts. Part a of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center. The time is marked t equals zero. The bottom part of the antenna is positive and the upper end of the antenna is negative. An electric field E acting upward is shown by an upward arrow. Part b of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center. The time is marked t equals capital T divided by four. The antenna has no polarity marked and a wave is shown to emerge from the A C source. An electric field E acting upward as shown by an upward arrow. The electric field E propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming part of the electromagnetic wave from the A C source. A quarter portion of the wave is shown above the horizontal axis. Part c of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center. The time is marked t equals capital T divided by two. The bottom part of the antenna is negative and the upper end of the antenna is positive and a wave is shown to emerge from the A C source. The electric field E propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming part of the electromagnetic wave from the A C source. A quarter portion of the wave is shown below the horizontal axis and a quarter portion of the wave is above the horizontal axis. Part d of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an AC generator at its center. The time is marked t equals capital T. The bottom part of the antenna is positive and the upper end of the antenna is negative. A wave is shown to emerge from the A C source. The electric field E propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming part of the electromagnetic wave from the A C source. A quarter portion of the wave is shown above the horizontal axis followed by a half wave below the horizontal axis and then again a quarter of a wave above the horizontal axis.](../resources/Figure_24_02_01a.jpg "This long straight gray wire with an AC generator at its center becomes a broadcast antenna for electromagnetic waves. Shown here are the charge distributions at four different times. The electric field (\( E \) ) propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming part of an electromagnetic wave. ")
{ #Figure1}

The **electric field** ( $$\vb{E} $$ )
shown surrounding the wire is produced by the charge distribution on the wire.
Both the $$\vb{E} $$ and the charge distribution vary as the current
changes. The changing field propagates outward at the speed of light.

There is an associated **magnetic field** ( $$\vb{B} $$ )
which propagates outward as well (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). The electric and
magnetic fields are closely related and propagate as an electromagnetic wave.
This is what happens in broadcast antennae such as those in radio and TV
stations.

Closer examination of the one complete cycle shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)
reveals the periodic nature of the generator-driven charges oscillating up and
down in the antenna and the electric field produced. At time $$t=0 $$ , there is
the maximum separation of charge, with negative charges at the top and positive
charges at the bottom, producing the maximum magnitude of the electric field (or
$$E $$ -field) in the upward direction. One-fourth of a cycle later, there is no
charge separation and the field next to the antenna is zero, while the maximum
$$E $$ -field has moved away at speed $$c $$.

As the process continues, the charge separation reverses and the field reaches
its maximum downward value, returns to zero, and rises to its maximum upward
value at the end of one complete cycle. The outgoing wave has an **amplitude** proportional to the maximum separation of charge. Its **wavelength** $$\left(
\lambda \right) $$ is proportional to the period of the oscillation and, hence,
is smaller for short periods or high frequencies. (As usual, wavelength and **frequency** $$\left(f\right) $$ are inversely proportional.)

### Electric and Magnetic Waves: Moving Together

Following Ampereâ€™s law, current in the antenna produces a magnetic field, as
shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). The relationship between $$\vb{E} $$ and
$$\vb{B} $$ is shown at one instant in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) (a). As the
current varies, the magnetic field varies in magnitude and direction.

![Part a of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center, functioning as a broadcast antenna. The antenna has a current I flowing vertically upward. The bottom end of the antenna is negative and the upper end of the antenna is positive. An electric field is shown to act vertically downward. The magnetic field lines B produced in the antenna are circular in direction around the wire. Part b of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center, functioning as a broadcast antenna. The electric field E and magnetic field B near the wire are shown perpendicular to each other. Part c of the diagram shows a long straight gray wire with an A C generator at its center, functioning as a broadcast antenna. The current is shown to flow in the antenna. The magnetic field varies with the current and propagates away from the antenna as a sine wave in the horizontal plane. The vibrations in the wave are marked as small arrows along the wave.](../resources/Figure_24_02_02a.jpg "(a) The current in the antenna produces the circular magnetic field lines. The current (\( I \) ) produces the separation of charge along the wire, which in turn creates the electric field as shown. (b) The electric and magnetic fields (\( E \) and \( B \) ) near the wire are perpendicular; they are shown here for one point in space. (c) The magnetic field varies with current and propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light. ")
{ #Figure2}

The magnetic field lines also propagate away from the antenna at the speed of
light, forming the other part of the electromagnetic wave, as seen
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) (b). The magnetic part of the wave has the same period
and wavelength as the electric part, since they are both produced by the same
movement and separation of charges in the antenna.

The electric and magnetic waves are shown together at one instant in time
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). The electric and magnetic fields produced by a long
straight wire antenna are exactly in phase. Note that they are perpendicular to
one another and to the direction of propagation, making this a **transverse
wave**.

![A part of the electromagnetic wave sent out from the antenna at one instant in time is shown. The wave is shown with the variation of two components, E and B, moving with velocity c. E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the vibrations of particles in the plane. B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the E wave. The B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because E and B are perpendicular to each other. E and B are in phase, and they are perpendicular to one another and to the direction of propagation.](../resources/Figure_24_02_03a.jpg "A part of the electromagnetic wave sent out from the antenna at one instant in time. The electric and magnetic fields (\( E \) and \( B \) ) are in phase, and they are perpendicular to one another and the direction of propagation. For clarity, the waves are shown only along one direction, but they propagate out in other directions too.")
{ #Figure3}

Electromagnetic waves generally propagate out from a source in all directions,
sometimes forming a complex radiation pattern. A linear antenna like this one
will not radiate parallel to its length, for example. The wave is shown in one
direction from the antenna in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) to illustrate its basic
characteristics.

Instead of the AC generator, the antenna can also be driven by an AC circuit. In
fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. But while a current in a
circuit needs a complete path, an antenna has a varying charge distribution
forming a **standing wave**, driven by the AC. The dimensions of the antenna are
critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves.
This is a **resonant** phenomenon and when we tune radios or TV, we vary
electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna.

### Receiving Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves carry energy away from their source, similar to a sound
wave carrying energy away from a standing wave on a guitar string. An antenna
for receiving EM signals works in reverse. And like antennas that produce EM
waves, receiver antennas are specially designed to resonate at particular
frequencies.

An incoming electromagnetic wave accelerates electrons in the antenna, setting
up a standing wave. If the radio or TV is switched on, electrical components
pick up and amplify the signal formed by the accelerating electrons. The signal
is then converted to audio and/or video format. Sometimes big receiver dishes
are used to focus the signal onto an antenna.

In fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. When designing circuits,
we often assume that energy does not quickly escape AC circuits, and mostly this
is true. A broadcast antenna is specially designed to enhance the rate of
electromagnetic radiation, and shielding is necessary to keep the radiation
close to zero. Some familiar phenomena are based on the production of
electromagnetic waves by varying currents. Your microwave oven, for example,
sends electromagnetic waves, called microwaves, from a concealed antenna that
has an oscillating current imposed on it.

### Relating $$E $$

-Field and $$B $$ -Field Strengths

There is a relationship between the $$E $$

- and $$B $$ -field strengths in an electromagnetic wave. This can be understood
  by again considering the antenna just described. The stronger the $$E $$
  -field created by a separation of charge, the greater the current and, hence,
  the greater the $$B $$ -field created.

Since current is directly proportional to voltage (Ohmâ€™s law) and voltage is
directly proportional to $$E $$ -field strength, the two should be directly
proportional. It can be shown that the magnitudes of the fields do have a
constant ratio, equal to the speed of light. That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{E}{B}=c $$
</div>

is the ratio of $$E $$ -field strength to $$B $$ -field strength in any
electromagnetic wave. This is true at all times and at all locations in space. A
simple and elegant result.

<div id="Example1" class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating  $$B $$
-Field Strength in an Electromagnetic Wave
</div>
What is the maximum strength of the  $$B $$
-field in an electromagnetic wave that has a maximum  $$E $$
-field strength of  $$1000 \text{V/m} $$ ?

**Strategy**

To find the $$B $$ -field strength, we rearrange the above equation to solve for
$$B $$, yielding

<div class="equation" >
 $$B=\frac{E}{c}. $$
</div>
**Solution**

We are given $$E $$ , and $$c $$ is the speed of light. Entering these into the
expression for $$B $$ yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$B=\frac{1000 \text{V/m}}{ 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}=3.33 \times 10^{-6}  \text{T}, $$
</div>
Where T stands for Tesla, a measure of magnetic field strength.

**Discussion**

The $$B $$ -field strength is less than a tenth of the Earthâ€™s admittedly weak
magnetic field. This means that a relatively strong electric field of 1000 V/m
is accompanied by a relatively weak magnetic field. Note that as this wave
spreads out, say with distance from an antenna, its field strengths become
progressively weaker.

</div>

The result of this example is consistent with the statement made in the
module [Maxwellâ€™s Equations: Electromagnetic Waves Predicted and Observed](../contents/ch24MaxwellsEquations)
that changing electric fields create relatively weak magnetic fields. They can
be detected in electromagnetic waves, however, by taking advantage of the
phenomenon of resonance, as Hertz did. A system with the same natural frequency
as the electromagnetic wave can be made to oscillate. All radio and TV receivers
use this principle to pick up and then amplify weak electromagnetic waves, while
rejecting all others not at their resonant frequency.

Take-Home Experiment: Antennas
</div>
For your TV or radio at home, identify the antenna, and sketch its shape. If you donâ€™t have cable, you might have an outdoor or indoor TV antenna. Estimate its size. If the TV signal is between 60 and 216 MHz for basic channels, then what is the wavelength of those EM waves?

Try tuning the radio and note the small range of frequencies at which a
reasonable signal for that station is received. (This is easier with digital
readout.) If you have a car with a radio and extendable antenna, note the
quality of reception as the length of the antenna is changed.

### Section Summary

* Electromagnetic waves are created by oscillating charges (which radiate
  whenever accelerated) and have the same frequency as the oscillation.
* Since the electric and magnetic fields in most electromagnetic waves are
  perpendicular to the direction in which the wave moves, it is ordinarily a
  transverse wave.
* The strengths of the electric and magnetic parts of the wave are related by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\frac{E}{B}=\text{c}, $$
  </div>

which implies that the magnetic field $$B $$ is very weak relative to the
electric field $$E $$ .

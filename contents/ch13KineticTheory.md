We have developed macroscopic definitions of pressure and temperature. Pressure
is the force divided by the area on which the force is exerted, and temperature
is measured with a thermometer. We gain a better understanding of pressure and
temperature from the kinetic theory of gases, which assumes that atoms and
molecules are in continuous random motion.

A second vector v primed starts at the point of impact and travels away from the wall at an angle. A dotted line perpendicular to the wall through the point of impact represents the component of the molecule&#x2019;s momentum that is perpendicular to the wall. A red vector F is pointing into the wall from the point of impact, representing the force of the molecule hitting the wall.](../resources/Figure_14_04_01.jpg "When a molecule collides with a rigid wall, the component of its momentum perpendicular to the wall is reversed. A force is thus exerted on the wall, creating pressure.")
{: #Figure1}

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the
wall of a container, so that it exerts a force on the wall (by Newton’s third
law). Because a huge number of molecules will collide with the wall in a short
time, we observe an average force per unit area. These collisions are the source
of pressure in a gas. As the number of molecules increases, the number of
collisions and thus the pressure increase. Similarly, the gas pressure is higher
if the average velocity of molecules is higher. The actual relationship is
derived in the [Things Great and Small](#fs-id1855032) feature below. The
following relationship is found:

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=\frac{1}{3}N m\overline{ {v}^{2}}, $$
</div>

where $$P $$ is the pressure (average force per unit area), $$V $$ is the volume
of gas in the container, $$N $$ is the number of molecules in the container, $$m
$$ is the mass of a molecule, and $$\overline{ {v}^{2}} $$ is the average of the
molecular speed squared.

What can we learn from this atomic and molecular version of the ideal gas law?
We can derive a relationship between temperature and the average translational
kinetic energy of molecules in a gas. Recall the previous expression of the
ideal gas law:

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=Nk_{B}T. $$
</div>

Equating the right-hand side of this equation with the right-hand side of
$$PV=\frac{1}{3}N m\overline{ {v}^{2}} $$ gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{1}{3}N m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=Nk_{B}T. $$

Making Connections: Things Great and Small—Atomic and Molecular Origin of Pressure in a Gas
</div>
[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows a box filled with a gas. We know from our previous discussions that putting more gas into the box produces greater pressure, and that increasing the temperature of the gas also produces a greater pressure. But why should increasing the temperature of the gas increase the pressure in the box? A look at the atomic and molecular scale gives us some answers, and an alternative expression for the ideal gas law.

The figure shows an expanded view of an elastic collision of a gas molecule with
the wall of a container. Calculating the average force exerted by such molecules
will lead us to the ideal gas law, and to the connection between temperature and
molecular kinetic energy. We assume that a molecule is small compared with the
separation of molecules in the gas, and that its interaction with other
molecules can be ignored. We also assume the wall is rigid and that the
molecule’s direction changes, but that its speed remains constant (and hence its
kinetic energy and the magnitude of its momentum remain constant as well). This
assumption is not always valid, but the same result is obtained with a more
detailed description of the molecule’s exchange of energy and momentum with the
wall.

![Diagram representing the pressures that a gas exerts on the walls of a box in a three-dimensional coordinate system with x, y, and z components.](../resources/Figure_14_04_02.jpg "Gas in a box exerts an outward pressure on its walls. A molecule colliding with a rigid wall has the direction of its velocity and momentum in the \( x \) -direction reversed. This direction is perpendicular to the wall. The components of its velocity momentum in the \( y \) - and \( z \) -directions are not changed, which means there is no force parallel to the wall.")
{: #Figure2}

If the molecule’s velocity changes in the $$x $$ -direction, its momentum
changes from $$-mv_{x} $$ to $$+mv_{x} $$ . Thus, its change in momentum is
$$\Delta mv = + mv_{x}-\left(-mv_{x}\right)=2mv_{x} $$ . The force exerted on
the molecule is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{2mv_{x}}{\Delta t}\text{.} $$
</div>
There is no force between the wall and the molecule until the molecule hits the wall. During the short time of the collision, the force between the molecule and wall is relatively large. We are looking for an average force; we take  $$\Delta t $$
 to be the average time between collisions of the molecule with this wall. It is the time it would take the molecule to go across the box and back (a distance  $$2l\right) $$
 at a speed of  $${v}_{x} $$ .
 Thus  $$\Delta t=2l/{v}_{x} $$ ,
 and the expression for the force becomes

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=\frac{2mv_{x}}{2l/{v}_{x}}=\frac{ mv_{x}^{2}}{l}\text{.} $$
</div>
This force is due to *one* molecule. We multiply by the number of molecules  $$N $$
 and use their average squared velocity to find the force

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=N\frac{m\overline{ {v}_{x}^{2}}}{l}, $$
</div>
where the bar over a quantity means its average value. We would like to have the force in terms of the speed  $$v $$ ,
 rather than the  $$x $$
-component of the velocity. We note that the total velocity squared is the sum of the squares of its components, so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\overline{ {v}_{x}^{2}}+\overline{ {v}_{y}^{2}}+\overline{ {v}_{z}^{2}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Because the velocities are random, their average components in all directions are the same:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{ {v}_{x}^{2}}=\overline{ {v}_{y}^{2}}=\overline{ {v}_{z}^{2}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{ {v}^{2}}=3\overline{ {v}_{x}^{2}}, $$
</div>
or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{ {v}_{x}^{2}}=\frac{1}{3}\overline{ {v}^{2}}. $$
</div>
Substituting  $$\frac{1}{3}\overline{ {v}^{2}} $$
 into the expression for  $$F $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=N\frac{m\overline{ {v}^{2}}}{3l}\text{.} $$
</div>
The pressure is  $$F/A, $$  so that we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{F}{A}=N\frac{m\overline{ {v}^{2}}}{3 A l}=\frac{1}{3}\frac{\text{Nm}\overline{ {v}^{2}}}{V}, $$
</div>
where we used  $$V= A l  $$  for the volume. This gives the important result.

<div class="equation" >
 $$PV=\frac{1}{3}\text{Nm}\overline{ {v}^{2}} $$
</div>
This equation is another expression of the ideal gas law.

</div>

We can get the average kinetic energy of a molecule, $$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ ,
from the right-hand side of the equation by canceling $$N $$ and multiplying by
3/2. This calculation produces the result that the average kinetic energy of a
molecule is directly related to absolute temperature.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T $$
</div>

The average translational kinetic energy of a molecule, $$\overline{\text{KE}}
$$ , is called **thermal energy** . The equation
$$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T $$ is a
molecular interpretation of temperature, and it has been found to be valid for
gases and reasonably accurate in liquids and solids. It is another definition of
temperature based on an expression of the molecular energy.

It is sometimes useful to rearrange
$$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T $$
**,** and solve for the average speed of molecules in a gas in terms of
temperature,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sqrt{\overline{ {v}^{2}}}={v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}, $$
</div>

where $${v}_{\text{rms}} $$ stands for root-mean-square (rms) speed.

Calculating Kinetic Energy and Speed of a Gas Molecule
</div>
(a) What is the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at  $$ 20.0\text{ºC} $$
 (room temperature)? (b) Find the rms speed of a nitrogen molecule  $$\left({\text{N}}_{2}\right) $$
 at this temperature.

**Strategy for (a)**

The known in the equation for the average kinetic energy is the temperature.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T $$
</div>
Before substituting values into this equation, we must convert the given temperature to kelvins. This conversion gives  $$T=\left( 20.0+273\right) \text{K = 293} \text{K}. $$
**Solution for (a)**

The temperature alone is sufficient to find the average translational kinetic
energy. Substituting the temperature into the translational kinetic energy
equation gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T=\frac{3}{2}\left( 1.38 \times 10^{-23}  \text{J/K}\right)\left(293 \text{K}\right)= 6.07 \times 10^{-21}  \text{J}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Strategy for (b)**

Finding the rms speed of a nitrogen molecule involves a straightforward
calculation using the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$\sqrt{\overline{ {v}^{2}}}={v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}, $$
</div>
but we must first find the mass of a nitrogen molecule. Using the molecular mass of nitrogen  $${\text{N}}_{2} $$
 from the periodic table,

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=\frac{2\left( 14.0067 \right) \times 10^{-3}  \text{kg/mol}}{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  {\text{mol}}^{-1}}= 4.65 \times 10^{-26}  \text{kg}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

Substituting this mass and the value for $$k $$ into the equation for $${v}_
{\text{rms}} $$ yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{3\left( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{J/K}\right)\left(293 \text{K}\right)}{ 4.65 \times 10^{-26} \text{kg}}}=511 \text{m/s}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Note that the average kinetic energy of the molecule is independent of the type
of molecule. The average translational kinetic energy depends only on absolute
temperature. The kinetic energy is very small compared to macroscopic energies,
so that we do not feel when an air molecule is hitting our skin. The rms
velocity of the nitrogen molecule is surprisingly large. These large molecular
velocities do not yield macroscopic movement of air, since the molecules move in
all directions with equal likelihood. The *mean free path* (the distance a
molecule can move on average between collisions) of molecules in air is very
small, and so the molecules move rapidly but do not get very far in a second.
The high value for rms speed is reflected in the speed of sound, however, which
is about 340 m/s at room temperature. The faster the rms speed of air molecules,
the faster that sound vibrations can be transferred through the air. The speed
of sound increases with temperature and is greater in gases with small molecular
masses, such as helium. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

</div>

![In part a of the figure, circles represent molecules distributed in a gas. Attached to each circle is a vector representing velocity. The circles have a random arrangement, while the vector arrows have random orientations and lengths. In part b of the figure, an arc represents a sound wave as it passes through a gas. The velocity of each molecule along the peak of the wave is roughly oriented parallel to the transmission direction of the wave.](../resources/Figure_14_04_03.jpg "(a) There are many molecules moving so fast in an ordinary gas that they collide a billion times every second. (b) Individual molecules do not move very far in a small amount of time, but disturbances like sound waves are transmitted at speeds related to the molecular speeds.")

Making Connections: Historical Note—Kinetic Theory of Gases
</div>
The kinetic theory of gases was developed by Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), who is best known in physics for his work on fluid flow (hydrodynamics). Bernoulli’s work predates the atomistic view of matter established by Dalton.

</div>

### Distribution of Molecular Speeds

The motion of molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction for
individual molecules, but a gas of many molecules has a predictable distribution
of molecular speeds. This distribution is called the *Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution*, after its originators, who calculated it based on kinetic theory,
and has since been confirmed experimentally. (See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).) The
distribution has a long tail, because a few molecules may go several times the
rms speed. The most probable speed $${v}_{\text{p}} $$ is less than the rms
speed $${v}_{\text{rms}} $$ .
[[Figure 5]](#Figure5) shows that the curve is shifted to higher speeds at
higher temperatures, with a broader range of speeds.

![A line graph of probability versus velocity in meters per second of oxygen gas at 300 kelvin. The graph is skewed to the right, with a peak probability just under 400 meters per second and a root-mean-square probability of about 500 meters per second.](../resources/Figure_14_04_04.jpg "The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas. The most likely speed \( v_{p} \) is less than the rms speed \( v_\text{rms} \). Although very high speeds are possible, only a tiny fraction of the molecules have speeds that are an order of magnitude greater than \( v_\text{rms} \).")
{: #Figure4}

The distribution of thermal speeds depends strongly on temperature. As
temperature increases, the speeds are shifted to higher values and the
distribution is broadened.

![Two distributions of probability versus velocity at two different temperatures plotted on the same graph. Temperature two is greater than Temperature one. The distribution for Temperature two has a peak with a lower probability, but a higher velocity than the distribution for Temperature one. The T sub two graph has a more normal distribution and is broader while the T sub one graph is more narrow and has a tail extending to the right.](../resources/Figure_14_04_05.jpg "The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is shifted to higher speeds and is broadened at higher temperatures.")
{: #Figure5}

What is the implication of the change in distribution with temperature shown
in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5) for humans? All other things being equal, if a person
has a fever, they are likely to lose more water molecules, particularly from
linings along moist cavities such as the lungs and mouth, creating a dry
sensation in the mouth.

Calculating Temperature: Escape Velocity of Helium Atoms
</div>
In order to escape Earth’s gravity, an object near the top of the atmosphere (at an altitude of 100 km) must travel away from Earth at 11.1 km/s. This speed is called the *escape velocity*. At what temperature would helium atoms have an rms speed equal to the escape velocity?

**Strategy**

Identify the knowns and unknowns and determine which equations to use to solve
the problem.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns:  $$v $$ is the escape velocity, 11.1 km/s.

2. Identify the unknowns: We need to solve for temperature, $$T $$ . We also
   need to solve for the mass $$m $$ of the helium atom.

3. Determine which equations are needed.

* To solve for mass $$m $$ of the helium atom, we can use information from the
  periodic table:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$m=\frac{\text{molar mass}}{\text{number of atoms per mole}}. $$
  </div>

* To solve for temperature $$T $$ , we can rearrange either

  <div class="equation" >
   $$\overline{\text{KE}}=\frac{1}{2}m\overline{ {v}^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T $$
  </div>
     or   
  <div class="equation" >
   $$\sqrt{\overline{ {v}^{2}}}={v}_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}} $$
  </div>
     to yield   
  <div class="equation" >
   $$T=\frac{m\overline{ {v}^{2}}}{3k}, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$k_{B} $$ is the Boltzmann constant and
   $$m $$ is the mass of a helium atom.

4. Plug the known values into the equations and solve for the unknowns.

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=\frac{\text{molar mass}}{\text{number of atoms per mole}}=\frac{ 4.0026 \times 10^{-3}  \text{kg/mol}}{ 6.02 \times 10^{23}  \text{mol}}= 6.65 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$T=\frac{\left( 6.65 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg}\right){\left( 11.1 \times 10^{3}  \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}}{3\left( 1.38 \times 10^{-23}  \text{J/K}\right)}= 1.98 \times 10^{4}\text{K} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This temperature is much higher than atmospheric temperature, which is
approximately 250 K  ($$-25\text{ºC} $$ or $$-10\text{ºF} $$)
at high altitude. Very few helium atoms are left in the atmosphere, but there
were many when the atmosphere was formed. The reason for the loss of helium
atoms is that there are a small number of helium atoms with speeds higher than
Earth’s escape velocity even at normal temperatures. The speed of a helium atom
changes from one instant to the next, so that at any instant, there is a small,
but nonzero chance that the speed is greater than the escape speed and the
molecule escapes from Earth’s gravitational pull. Heavier molecules, such as
oxygen, nitrogen, and water (very little of which reach a very high altitude),
have smaller rms speeds, and so it is much less likely that any of them will
have speeds greater than the escape velocity. In fact, so few have speeds above
the escape velocity that billions of years are required to lose significant
amounts of the atmosphere. [[Figure 6]](#Figure6) shows the impact of a lack of
an atmosphere on the Moon. Because the gravitational pull of the Moon is much
weaker, it has lost almost its entire atmosphere. The comparison between Earth
and the Moon is discussed in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

In fact, the light is coming from the Sun. Because the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is so low (about 1/6 that of Earth), the Moon&#x2019;s escape velocity is much smaller. As a result, gas molecules escape very easily from the Moon, leaving it with virtually no atmosphere. Even during the daytime, the sky is black because there is no gas to scatter sunlight.

Check Your Understanding
</div>
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
If you consider a very small object such as a grain of pollen, in a gas, then the number of atoms and molecules striking its surface would also be relatively small. Would the grain of pollen experience any fluctuations in pressure due to statistical fluctuations in the number of gas atoms and molecules striking it in a given amount of time?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-element-type="check-understanding" data-print-placement="here" markdown="1">
Yes. Such fluctuations actually occur for a body of any size in a gas, but since the numbers of atoms and molecules are immense for macroscopic bodies, the fluctuations are a tiny percentage of the number of collisions, and the averages spoken of in this section vary imperceptibly. Roughly speaking the fluctuations are proportional to the inverse square root of the number of collisions, so for small bodies they can become significant. This was actually observed in the 19th century for pollen grains in water, and is known as the Brownian effect.

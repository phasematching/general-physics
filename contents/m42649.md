A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes
nuclear radiation so useful? First, $$\gamma $$ radiation can easily penetrate
tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body.
Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical
compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound
designed for specific purposes. The compound is said to be **tagged**. A tagged
compound used for medical purposes is called a **radiopharmaceutical**{: class="
term"}. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and
concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information.
For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and
this information can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical
which the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to
detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such
bone scans. Radioisotopes are also used to determine the functioning of body
organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the
thyroid gland.

### Medical Application

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists certain medical diagnostic uses of
radiopharmaceuticals, including isotopes and activities that are typically
administered. Many organs can be imaged with a variety of nuclear isotopes
replacing a stable element by a radioactive isotope. One common diagnostic
employs iodine to image the thyroid, since iodine is concentrated in that organ.
The most active thyroid cells, including cancerous cells, concentrate the most
iodine and, therefore, emit the most radiation. Conversely, hypothyroidism is
indicated by lack of iodine uptake. Note that there is more than one isotope
that can be used for several types of scans. Another common nuclear diagnostic
is the thallium scan for the cardiovascular system, particularly used to
evaluate blockages in the coronary arteries and examine heart activity. The salt
TlCl can be used, because it acts like NaCl and follows the blood. Gallium-67
accumulates where there is rapid cell growth, such as in tumors and sites of
infection. Hence, it is useful in cancer imaging. Usually, the patient receives
the injection one day and has a whole body scan 3 or 4 days later because it can
take several days for the gallium to build up.

Note that [[Table 1]](#Table1) lists many diagnostic uses for $${}^{99
\text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ , where “m” stands for a metastable state of the
technetium nucleus. Perhaps 80 percent of all radiopharmaceutical procedures
employ $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ because of its many advantages. One is
that the decay of its metastable state produces a single, easily identified
0.142-MeV $$\gamma $$ ray. Additionally, the radiation dose to the patient is
limited by the short 6.0-h half-life of $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ . And,
although its half-life is short, it is easily and continuously produced on site.
The basic process for production is neutron activation of molybdenum, which
quickly $$\beta $$ decays into $${}^{99 \text{m}}\text{Tc} $$ . Technetium-99m
can be attached to many compounds to allow the imaging of the skeleton, heart,
lungs, kidneys, etc.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows one of the simpler methods of imaging the
concentration of nuclear activity, employing a device called an **Anger camera**
or **gamma camera**. A piece of lead with holes bored through it collimates
$$\gamma $$ rays emerging from the patient, allowing detectors to receive
$$\gamma $$ rays from specific directions only. The computer analysis of
detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection
method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a
two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view),
because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.

![The image shows the head of a man scanned by an Anger camera. The camera consists of a lead collimator and array of detectors. Gamma rays emerging from the man&#x2019;s head pass through the lead collimator and produce light flashes in the scintillators. The photomultiplier tubes convert the light output to electrical signals for computer image generation.](../resources/Figure_33_01_02.jpg "An Anger or gamma camera consists of a lead collimator and an array of detectors. Gamma rays produce light flashes in the scintillators. The light output is converted to an electrical signal by the photomultipliers. A computer constructs an image from the detector output.")
{: #Figure2}

Imaging techniques much like those in x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans use
nuclear activity in patients to form three-dimensional
images. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a patient in a circular array of detectors
that may be stationary or rotated, with detector output used by a computer to
construct a detailed image. This technique is called **single-photon-emission
computed tomography(SPECT)** or sometimes simply SPET. The spatial resolution of
this technique is poor, about 1 cm, but the contrast (i.e. the difference in
visual properties that makes an object distinguishable from other objects and
the background) is good.

![A man lying down, going through a cylindrical scanning machine.](../resources/Figure_33_01_04.jpg "SPECT uses a geometry similar to a CT scanner to form an image of the concentration of a radiopharmaceutical compound. (credit: Woldo, Wikimedia Commons)")
{: #Figure3}

Images produced by $${\beta }^{+} $$ emitters have become important in recent
years. When the emitted positron (  $${\beta }^{+} $$ )
encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two $$\gamma $$
rays. These $$\gamma $$ rays have identical 0.511-MeV energies (the energy comes
from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly
away from one another, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin
accurately, as shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). The system is called **positron
emission tomography (PET)**. It requires detectors on opposite sides to
simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511-MeV energy and
utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans.
Examples of $${\beta }^{+} $$ -emitting isotopes used in PET are
$${}^{11}\text{C} $$ , $${}^{13}\text{N} $$ , $${}^{15}\text{O} $$ , and
$${}^{18}\text{F} $$ , as seen in [[Table 1]](#Table1). This list includes C, N,
and O, and so they have the advantage of being able to function as tags for
natural body compounds. Its resolution of 0.5 cm is better than that of SPECT;
the accuracy and sensitivity of PET scans make them useful for examining the
brain’s anatomy and function. The brain’s use of oxygen and water can be
monitored with $${}^{15}\text{O} $$ . PET is used extensively for diagnosing
brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions prior to a
confirmation of Alzheimer’s disease. PET can locate regions in the brain that
become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking,
closing their eyes, and so on.

![The figure shows a patient undergoing a scan in a cylindrical device. The P E T system uses two gamma ray photons produced by positron electron annihilation. These gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions.](../resources/Figure_33_01_05.jpg "A PET system takes advantage of the two identical \( \gamma \)-ray photons produced by positron-electron annihilation. These \( \gamma \) rays are emitted in opposite directions, so that the line along which each pair is emitted is determined. Various events detected by several pairs of detectors are then analyzed by the computer to form an accurate image.")

Is it a tumor? Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can tell. Your head is full of tiny radio transmitters (the nuclear spins of the hydrogen nuclei of your water molecules). In an MRI unit, these little radios can be made to broadcast their positions, giving a detailed picture of the inside of your head.

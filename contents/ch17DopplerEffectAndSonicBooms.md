The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the **Doppler effect**. The high-pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch
roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer. The closer the
motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle
moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in
frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. It is so familiar that
it is used to imply motion and children often mimic it in play.

The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to
motion of either the source or the observer. Although less familiar, this effect
is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For example, if
you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s
frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. The actual change in frequency
due to relative motion of source and observer is called a **Doppler shift**. The
Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and
mathematician Christian Johann Doppler (1803–1853), who did experiments with
both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example, had musicians
play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks
as a train passed by. Their music was observed both on and off the train, and
changes in frequency were measured.

What causes the Doppler shift? [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), [[Figure 2]](#Figure2),
and [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) compare sound waves emitted by stationary and moving
sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from
the point where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of
the spheres representing the air compressions in the sound wave centered on the
same point, and the stationary observers on either side see the same wavelength
and frequency as emitted by the source, as in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). If the
source is moving, as in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), then the situation is different.
Each compression of the air moves out in a sphere from the point where it was
emitted, but the point of emission moves. This moving emission point causes the
air compressions to be closer together on one side and farther apart on the
other. Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on
the right in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)), and longer in the opposite direction (on
the left in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). Finally, if the observers move, as
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), the frequency at which they receive the compressions
changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher
frequency, and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower
frequency.

![Sound waves coming out of a car stopped on a road are shown as spherical areas of compression. The waves are shown to reach two observers, X and Y, standing on opposite sides of the car.](../resources/Figure_18_04_02a.jpg "Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.")
{: #Figure1}

![Two observers X and Y are standing at two ends of a road. A car is shown to move from observer X on the left toward observer Y on the right. The sound waves are shown as spherical air compressions spreading out from points from which they are emitted marked from one through five. The air compressions are shown to arrive more frequently for the observer Y toward whom the car moves, compared to the compressions reaching X.](../resources/Figure_18_04_03a.jpg "Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.")
{: #Figure2}

![A car is shown stopped on a road. Two observers are shown crossing the road from behind the car. The observer X on the left is moving away from the car, and observer Y on the right is approaching the car. The sound waves coming from a point in the car are shown as spherical air compressions that reach the observers at different frequencies.](../resources/Figure_18_04_04a.jpg "The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.")
{: #Figure3}

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by $${v}_{w}=f\lambda $$ ,
where $${v}_{w} $$ is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and
has the same speed $${v}_{w} $$ in that medium whether the source is moving or
not. Thus $$f $$ multiplied by $$\lambda $$ is a constant. Because the observer
on the right in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) receives a shorter wavelength, the
frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left
receives a longer wavelength, and hence he hears a lower frequency. The same
thing happens in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). A higher frequency is received by the
observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is received by an
observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of
source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency.
Relative motion apart decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed is,
the greater the effect.

<div class="title">
The Doppler Effect
</div>
The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source. There are Doppler shifts in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for example. Doppler shifts can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a medical diagnostic. The recession of galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from them and has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by observations of Doppler shifts.

</div>

For a stationary observer and a moving source, the frequency *f*<sub>obs</sub>
received by the observer can be shown to be

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right), $$
</div>

where $${f}_{s} $$ is the frequency of the source, $${v}_{s} $$ is the speed of
the source along a line joining the source and observer, and $${v}_{w} $$ is the
speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the
plus sign for motion away from the observer, producing the appropriate shifts up
and down in frequency. Note that the greater the speed of the source, the
greater the effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the
frequency received by the observer $${f}_{\text{obs}} $$ is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}}\right), $$
</div>

where $${v}_{\text{obs}} $$ is the speed of the observer along a line joining
the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the source, and
the minus is for motion away from the source.

Calculate Doppler Shift: A Train Horn
</div>
Suppose a train that has a 150-Hz horn is moving at 35.0 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/s.

(a) What frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the
tracks as the train approaches and after it passes?

(b) What frequency is observed by the train’s engineer traveling on the train?

**Strategy**

To find the observed frequency in (a), $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{
{v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right), $$ must be used because the source is moving.
The minus sign is used for the approaching train, and the plus sign for the
receding train. In (b), there are two Doppler shifts—one for a moving source and
the other for a moving observer.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Enter known values into $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{
{v}_{w} - {v}_{s}}\right). $$
<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}-{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(\frac{340 \text{m/s}}{340 \text{m/s} - 35.0 \text{m/s}}\right) $$
</div>
(2) Calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train approaches.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{obs}=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(1.11\right)=167 \text{Hz} $$
</div>
(3) Use the same equation with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train recedes.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}+{v}_{s}}\right)=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(\frac{340 \text{m/s}}{340 \text{m/s}+35.0 \text{m/s}}\right) $$
</div>
(4) Calculate the second frequency.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{obs}=\left(150 \text{Hz}\right)\left(0.907\right)=136 \text{Hz} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (a)**

The numbers calculated are valid when the train is far enough away that the
motion is nearly along the line joining train and observer. In both cases, the
shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is 17.0 Hz for
motion toward and 14.0 Hz for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric.

**Solution for (b)**

(1) Identify knowns:

* It seems reasonable that the engineer would receive the same frequency as
  emitted by the horn, because the relative velocity between them is zero.
* Relative to the medium (air), the speeds are $${v}_{s}={v}_{\text{obs}}=35.0
  m/s. $$
* The first Doppler shift is for the moving observer; the second is for the
  moving source.

(2) Use the following equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=\left[{f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{\text{obs}}}{ {v}_{w}}\right)\right]\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w}±{v}_{s}}\right). $$
</div>
The quantity in the square brackets is the Doppler-shifted frequency due to a moving observer. The factor on the right is the effect of the moving source.

(3) Because the train engineer is moving in the direction toward the horn, we
must use the plus sign for $${v}_{obs}; $$ however, because the horn is also
moving in the direction away from the engineer, we also use the plus sign for
$${v}_{s} $$ . But the train is carrying both the engineer and the horn at the
same velocity, so $${v}_{s}={v}_{obs} $$ . As a result, everything but $${f}_{s}
$$ cancels, yielding

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}. $$
</div>
**Discussion for (b)**

We may expect that there is no change in frequency when source and observer move
together because it fits your experience. For example, there is no Doppler shift
in the frequency of conversations between driver and passenger on a motorcycle.
People talking when a wind moves the air between them also observe no Doppler
shift in their conversation. The crucial point is that source and observer are
not moving relative to each other.

### Sonic Booms to Bow Wakes

What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane,
that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? The answer to this question
applies not only to sound but to all other waves as well.

Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of
frequency $${f}_{s} $$ . The greater the plane’s speed $${v}_{s} $$ , the
greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value observed for $${f}_
{\text{obs}} $$ . Now, as $${v}_{s} $$ approaches the speed of sound, $${f}_
{\text{obs}} $$ approaches infinity, because the denominator in $${f}_
{\text{obs}}={f}_{s}\left(\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {v}_{w} ± {v}_{s}}\right) $$
approaches zero. At the speed of sound, this result means that in front of the
source, each successive wave is superimposed on the previous one because the
source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the
same instant, and so the frequency is infinite. (Before airplanes exceeded the
speed of sound, some people argued it would be impossible because such
constructive superposition would produce pressures great enough to destroy the
airplane.) If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the
observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the approaching
source are mixed with those from it when receding. This mixing appears messy,
but something interesting happens—a sonic boom is created. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).)

![The diagram shows a sound wave with spherical air compressions emerging from a source moving toward the right. The source is shown to move with a velocity v sub s. The spherical air compressions are shown to move with velocity v sub w. The interference of sound waves is shown along two lines, one on each side of the waves. The angle between these two lines is labeled theta.](../resources/Figure_18_04_05a.jpg "Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the point where they are emitted, but the source moves ahead of each. Constructive interference along the lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions) creates a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed of the source, the smaller the angle \( \theta \).")
{: #Figure4}

There is constructive interference along the lines shown (a cone in three
dimensions) from similar sound waves arriving there simultaneously. This
superposition forms a disturbance called a **sonic boom**, a constructive
interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the
cone, the interference is mostly destructive, and so the sound intensity there
is much less than on the shock wave. An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one
from its nose and one from its tail. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) During
television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be
heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to
pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating
the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as
seen in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude,
pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as
rattle nerves. Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights
are banned over populated areas of the United States.

![An airplane is shown to fly above three observers on the ground. There are two conical shock waves or sonic booms created by the nose and tail of the aircraft. The observer on the left is shown to receive the conical shock wave from the tail of the aircraft, the observer in the middle receives the conical shock wave from the nose of the aircraft, and the observer on the right has not heard any sound, she is just wondering what is happening.](../resources/Figure_18_04_06a.jpg "Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.")
{: #Figure5}

Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A **bow
wake**, such as the one in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6), is created when the wave
source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in
circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped
wake trailing the source. A more exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic
particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light travels in that
medium. (In a vacuum, the maximum speed of light will be $$c= 3.00 \times 10^{8}
\text{m/s} $$ ; in the medium of water, the speed of light is closer to $$0.75c
$$ . If the particle creates light in its passage, that light spreads on a cone
with an angle indicative of the speed of the particle, as illustrated
in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). Such a bow wake is called Cerenkov radiation and is
commonly observed in particle physics.

![Photograph of a black duck swimming in water. The path left behind by the duck in water shows a near cone shape.](../resources/Figure_18_04_07a.jpg "Bow wake created by a duck. Constructive interference produces the rather structured wake, while there is relatively little wave action inside the wake, where interference is mostly destructive. (credit: Horia Varlan, Flickr)")

![Photograph of the blue glow, in a research reactor pool.](../resources/Figure_18_04_08a.jpg "The blue glow in this research reactor pool is Cerenkov radiation caused by subatomic particles traveling faster than the speed of light in water. (credit: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)")
{: #Figure7}

Doppler shifts and sonic booms are interesting sound phenomena that occur in all
types of waves. They can be of considerable use. For example, the Doppler shift
in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, while police use the
Doppler shift in radar (a microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology,
the Doppler shift is used to track the motion of storm clouds; such “Doppler
Radar” can give velocity and direction and rain or snow potential of imposing
weather fronts. In astronomy, we can examine the light emitted from distant
galaxies and determine their speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away from
us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer
wavelength—the so-called red shift. Such information from galaxies far, far away
has allowed us to estimate the age of the universe (from the Big Bang) as about
14 billion years.

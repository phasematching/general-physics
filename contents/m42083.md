</div>

In [Kinematics](/contents/m42122), we studied motion along a straight line and
introduced such concepts as displacement, velocity, and
acceleration. [Two-Dimensional Kinematics](/contents/m42126) dealt with motion
in two dimensions. Projectile motion is a special case of two-dimensional
kinematics in which the object is projected into the air, while being subject to
the gravitational force, and lands a distance away. In this chapter, we consider
situations where the object does not land but moves in a curve. We begin the
study of uniform circular motion by defining two angular quantities needed to
describe rotational motion.

### Rotation Angle

When objects rotate about some axis‚Äîfor example, when the CD (compact disc)
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3402904)
rotates about its center‚Äîeach point in the object follows a circular arc.
Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. Each **pit**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id2654027} used to record sound along this line
moves through the same angle in the same amount of time. The rotation angle is
the amount of rotation and is analogous to linear distance. We define the 
**rotation angle**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3255842} $$ \Delta\theta $$
to be the ratio of the arc length to the radius of curvature:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-211">
 $$ \Delta\theta =\frac{\Delta s }{r}. $$ 
</div>

![The figure shows the back side of a compact disc.
There is a scratched part on the upper right side of the C D,
about one-fifth size of the whole area, with inner circular
dots clearly visible. Two line segments are drawn enclosing
the scratched area from the border of the C D to the middle
plastic portion. A curved arrow is drawn between the two line
segments near this middle portion and angle delta theta 
written alongside it.](../resources/Figure_07_01_01aa.jpg "All points on a CD travel 
in circular arcs. The pits along a line from the center to the edge all move through
the same angle \( \Delta \theta \)")
{: #import-auto-id3402904}

![A circle of radius r and center O is shown. A radius O-A of the circle
is rotated through angle delta theta about the center O to terminate as radius O-B.
The arc length A-B is marked as delta s.](../resources/Figure_07_01_01ab.jpg "The radius of a circle 
is rotated through an angle \( \Delta \theta \). The arc length \( \Delta s \)
is described on the circumference. ")
{: #import-auto-id3418263}

The **arc length**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2679165} $$ \Delta s $$ is
the distance traveled along a circular path as shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3418263) Note that $$ r $$ is the 
**radius of curvature**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2920709} of the circular path.

We know that for one complete revolution, the arc length is the circumference of
a circle of radius $$ r $$. The circumference of a circle is $$ 2\pi r $$. Thus
for one complete revolution the rotation angle is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-191">
 $$ \Delta\theta =\frac{2\pi r}{r}=2\pi . $$ 
</div>

This result is the basis for defining the units used to measure rotation angles,
$$ \Delta\theta $$ to be **radians**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2625941} (rad), defined so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-135">
 $$ 2\pi \text{rad}=1 \text{revolution.} $$ 
</div>

A comparison of some useful angles expressed in both degrees and radians is
shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2588905).

![A circle is shown. Two radii of the circle, inclined at an acute angle delta theta, are shown. 
On one of the radii, two points, one and two are marked. The point one is inside the circle through which an 
arc between the two radii is shown. The point two is on the circumference of the circle. The two arc lengths 
are delta s one and delta s two respectively for the two points.](../resources/Figure_07_01_02a.jpg 
"Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle \( \Delta \theta \), but point 2 moves through a greater arc length 
\( \Delta s \) because it is at a greater distance from the center of rotation \( r \) ")
{: #import-auto-id2442865}

If $$ \Delta\theta =2\pi $$ rad, then the CD has made one complete revolution,
and every point on the CD is back at its original position. Because there are $$
360^\circ $$ in a circle or one revolution, the relationship between radians and
degrees is thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-808">
 $$ 2\pi \text{rad}=360^\circ $$ 
</div>

so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-873">
 $$ 1\text{rad}=\frac{360^\circ}{2\pi }\approx 57.3^\circ . $$ 
</div>

### Angular Velocity

How fast is an object rotating? We define **angular velocity**{: data-type="
term" #import-auto-id2962847} $$ \omega $$ as the rate of change of an angle. In
symbols, this is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-759">
 $$ \omega =\frac{\Delta\theta }{\Delta t }, $$ 
</div>

where an angular rotation $$ \Delta\theta $$ takes place in a time $$ \Delta t
$$. The greater the rotation angle in a given amount of time, the greater the
angular velocity. The units for angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s).

Angular velocity $$ \omega $$ is analogous to linear velocity $$ v $$. To get
the precise relationship between angular and linear velocity, we again consider
a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves an arc length $$ \Delta s $$ in a time
$$ \Delta t $$, and so it has a linear velocity

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-400">
 $$ v=\frac{\Delta s }{\Delta t }. $$ 
</div>

From $$ \Delta\theta =\frac{\Delta s }{r} $$ we see that $$ \Delta s
=r\Delta\theta $$. Substituting this into the expression for $$ v $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-637">
 $$ v=\frac{r\Delta\theta }{\Delta t }=r \omega . $$ 
</div>

We write this relationship in two different ways and gain two different
insights:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-639">
 $$ v=r \omega \text{ or }\omega =\frac{v}{r}. $$ 
</div>

The first relationship in $$ v=r \omega \text{ or }\omega =\frac{v}{r} $$ states
that the linear velocity $$ v $$ is proportional to the distance from the center
of rotation, thus, it is largest for a point on the rim (largest $$ r $$
), as you might expect. We can also call this linear speed $$ v $$ of a point on
the rim the *tangential speed*. The second relationship in $$ v=r \omega \text{
or }\omega =\frac{v}{r} $$ can be illustrated by considering the tire of a
moving car. Note that the speed of a point on the rim of the tire is the same as
the speed $$ v $$ of the car. See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2931190). So the
faster the car moves, the faster the tire spins‚Äîlarge $$ v $$ means a large $$
\omega $$, because $$ v=r \omega $$. Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at
the same angular velocity ( $$ \omega $$
) will produce a greater linear speed ( $$ v $$
) for the car.

![The given figure shows the front wheel of a car. The radius of the car wheel, r, is
shown as an arrow and the linear velocity, v, is shown with a green horizontal arrow
pointing rightward. The angular velocity, omega, is shown with a clockwise-curved arrow
over the wheel.](../resources/Figure_07_01_03a.jpg "A car moving at a velocity \( v \)
to the right has a tire rotating 
with an angular velocity \( \omega \).
The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is \( v \) , the same as
if the car were jacked up. Thus the car moves forward at linear velocity
\( r \omega \) , where \( r \) is the tire 
radius. A larger angular 
velocity for the tire means a greater velocity for the car. ")

<div data-type="title">
How Fast Does a Car Tire Spin?
</div>
Calculate the angular velocity of a 0.300 m radius car tire when the car travels at  $$ 15.0\text{m/s} $$ 
(about $$54 \text{km/h} $$). See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2931190).

**Strategy**

Because the linear speed of the tire rim is the same as the speed of the car, we
have $$ v=15.0 \text{m/s}. $$ The radius of the tire is given to be $$ r=0.300
\text{m}. $$ Knowing $$ v $$ and $$ r $$, we can use the second relationship in
$$ v=r \omega \mathrm{, }\omega =\frac{v}{r} $$ to calculate the angular
velocity.

**Solution**

To calculate the angular velocity, we will use the following relationship:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-97">
 $$ \omega =\frac{v}{r}. $$ 
</div>
Substituting the knowns,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-451">
 $$ \omega =\frac{15.0\text{m/s}}{0.300\text{m}}=50.0\text{rad/s.} $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

When we cancel units in the above calculation, we get 50.0/s. But the angular
velocity must have units of rad/s. Because radians are actually unitless (
radians are defined as a ratio of distance), we can simply insert them into the
answer for the angular velocity. Also note that if an earth mover with much
larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius, were moving at the same speed of 15.0 m/s,
its tires would rotate more slowly. They would have an angular velocity

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-971">
 $$ \omega =\left(15.0\text{m/s}\right)/\left(1.20\text{m}\right)=12.5\text{rad/s.} $$ 
</div>
</div>

Both $$ \omega $$ and $$ v $$ have directions (hence they are angular and
linear *velocities*, respectively). Angular velocity has only two directions
with respect to the axis of rotation‚Äîit is either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Linear velocity is tangent to the path, as illustrated
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1452850).

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id2603294} Uniform circular motion is motion in a circle at
  constant speed. The rotation angle $$ \Delta\theta $$ is defined as the ratio
  of the arc length to the radius of curvature:
  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-213">
   $$ \Delta\theta =\frac{\Delta s }{r}, $$ 
  </div>

  where arc length $$ \Delta s $$ is distance traveled along a circular path and
  $$ r $$ is the radius of curvature of the circular path. The quantity $$
  \Delta\theta $$ is measured in units of radians (rad), for which

  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-567">
   $$ 2\pi \text{rad}=360^\circ\text{= }1\text{ revolution.} $$ 
  </div>

* {: #import-auto-id2384053} The conversion between radians and degrees is $$
  1\text{rad}=57.3^\circ $$ .

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider an amusement park ride in which participants are rotated about a
vertical axis in a cylinder with vertical walls. Once the angular velocity
reaches its full value, the floor drops away and friction between the walls and
the riders prevents them from sliding down. Construct a problem in which you
calculate the necessary angular velocity that assures the riders will not slide

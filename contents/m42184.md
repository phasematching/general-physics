Angular momentum is a vector and, therefore, *has direction as well as magnitude*. Torque affects both the direction and the magnitude of angular momentum. What is the direction of the angular momentum of a rotating object like the disk in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1549167)? The figure shows the **right-hand rule**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3008939} used to find the direction of both angular momentum and angular velocity. Both <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{L} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 are vectors—each has direction and magnitude. Both can be represented by arrows. The right-hand rule defines both to be perpendicular to the plane of rotation in the direction shown. Because angular momentum is related to angular velocity by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mi fontstyle="italic">I</mi><mtext mathvariant="bold">ω</mtext></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{L=Iω} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. Notice in the figure that both point along the axis of rotation.

![In figure a, a disk is rotating in counter clockwise direction. The direction of the angular momentum is shown as an upward vector at the centre of the disk. The vector is labeled as L is equal to I-omega. In figure b, a right hand is shown. The fingers are curled in the direction of rotation and the thumb is pointed vertically upward in the direction of angular velocity and angular momentum.](../resources/Figure_11_07_01a.jpg "Figure (a) shows a disk is rotating counterclockwise when viewed from above. Figure (b) shows the right-hand rule. The direction of angular velocity &#10; &#10;  &#x3C9; &#10; &#10; size and angular momentum &#10; &#10;  L &#10; &#10; are defined to be the direction in which the thumb of your right hand points when you curl your fingers in the direction of the disk&#x2019;s rotation as shown."){: #import-auto-id1549167}

Now, recall that torque changes angular momentum as expressed by

 that creates it. This result is illustrated in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3122626), which shows the direction of torque and the angular momentum it creates.

Let us now consider a bicycle wheel with a couple of handles attached to it, as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3014014). (This device is popular in demonstrations among physicists, because it does unexpected things.) With the wheel rotating as shown, its angular momentum is to the woman\'s left. Suppose the person holding the wheel tries to rotate it as in the figure. Her natural expectation is that the wheel will rotate in the direction she pushes it—but what happens is quite different. The forces exerted create a torque that is horizontal toward the person, as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3014014)(a). This torque creates a change in angular momentum <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{L} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

 add, giving a new angular momentum with direction that is inclined more toward the person than before. The axis of the wheel has thus moved *perpendicular to the forces exerted on it*, instead of in the expected direction.

![In figure a, a plane is shown. Force F, lying in the same plane, is acting at a point in the plane. At a point, at distant-r from the force, a vertical vector is shown labeled as tau, the torque. In figure b, there is a child on a horse on a merry-go-round. The radius of the merry-go-round is r units. At the foot of the horse, a vector along the plane of merry-go-round is shown. At the centre, the direction of torque tau, angular velocity omega, and angular momentum L are shown as vertical vectors.](../resources/Figure_11_07_02a.jpg "In figure (a), the torque is perpendicular to the plane formed by r size 12{r} {} and F size 12{F} {} and is the direction your right thumb would point to if you curled your fingers in the direction of F size 12{F} {}.

![In figure a, a lady is holding the spinning bike wheel with her hands. The wheel is rotating in counter clockwise direction. The direction of the force applied by her left hand is shown downward and that by her right hand in upward direction. The direction of angular momentum is along the axis of rotation of the wheel. In figure b, addition of two vectors L and delta-L is shown. The resultant of the two vectors is labeled as L plus delta L. The direction of rotation is counterclockwise.](../resources/Figure_11_07_03a.jpg "In figure (a), a person holding the spinning bike wheel lifts it with her right hand and pushes down with her left hand in an attempt to rotate the wheel. This action creates a torque directly toward her. This torque causes a change in angular momentum &#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;&#x394;&#10;  L &#10; &#10; in exactly the same direction.

The wheel moves toward the person, perpendicular to the forces she exerts on it."){: #import-auto-id3014014 height="300"}

This same logic explains the behavior of gyroscopes. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1462916) shows the two forces acting on a spinning gyroscope. The torque produced is perpendicular to the angular momentum, thus the direction of the torque is changed, but not its magnitude. The gyroscope *precesses* around a vertical axis, since the torque is always horizontal and perpendicular to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{L} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

. If the gyroscope is *not* spinning, it acquires angular momentum in the direction of the torque (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext><mo stretchy="false">=</mo><mrow><mtext>Δ</mtext><mtext mathvariant="bold">L</mtext></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow /></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{L=ΔL} {}</annotation></semantics></math>

), and it rotates around a horizontal axis, falling over just as we would expect.

Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope. Its angular momentum is along its axis and points at Polaris, the North Star. But Earth is slowly precessing (once in about 26,000 years) due to the torque of the Sun and the Moon on its nonspherical shape.

![In figure a, the gyroscope is rotating in counter clockwise direction. The weight of the gyroscope is acting downward. The supportive force is acting at the base. The line of action of the weight and supportive force are different. The torque is acting along the radius of the horizontal circular part of gyroscope. In figure b, the two vectors L and L plus delta L are shown. The vectors start from a point at the bottom of the figure and terminate at two points on a horizontal dotted circle, directed in counter clockwise direction, at the top of the figure. Another vector delta L starts from the head of vector L and terminates at the head of vector L plus delta L.](../resources/Figure_11_07_04a.jpg "As seen in figure (a), the forces on a spinning gyroscope are its weight and the supporting force from the stand. These forces create a horizontal torque on the gyroscope, which create a change in angular momentum &#x394;L size 12{L} {} that is also horizontal. In figure (b), &#x394;L  size 12{L} {} and L  size 12{L} {} add to produce a new angular momentum with the same magnitude, but different direction, so that the gyroscope precesses in the direction shown instead of falling over."){: #import-auto-id1462916}

Rotational kinetic energy is associated with angular momentum? Does that mean that rotational kinetic energy is a vector?

<div data-type="solution" data-print-placement="here" markdown="1">
No, energy is always a scalar whether motion is involved or not. No form of energy has a direction in space and you can see that rotational kinetic energy does not depend on the direction of motion just as linear kinetic energy is independent of the direction of motion.

**Integrated Concepts**

The axis of Earth makes a 23.5° angle with a direction perpendicular to the plane of Earth’s orbit. As shown in [[link]](#import-auto-id1403686), this axis precesses, making one complete rotation in 25,780 y.

(a) Calculate the change in angular momentum in half this time.

(b) What is the average torque producing this change in angular momentum?

(c) If this torque were created by a single force (it is not) acting at the most effective point on the equator, what would its magnitude be?

![In the figure, the Earth&#x2019;s image is shown. There are two vectors inclined at an angle of twenty three point five degree to the vertical, starting from the centre of the Earth. At the heads of the two vectors there is a circular shape, directed in counter clockwise direction. An angular momentum vector, directed toward left, along its diameter, is shown. The plane of the Earth&#x2019;s orbit is shown as a horizontal line through its center.](../resources/Figure_11_07_06a.jpg "The Earth&#x2019;s axis slowly precesses, always making an angle of 23.5&#xB0; with the direction perpendicular to the plane of Earth&#x2019;s orbit.

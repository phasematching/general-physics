**Friction**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298484489} is a force that is
around us all the time that opposes relative motion between systems in contact
but also allows us to move (which you have discovered if you have ever tried to
walk on ice). While a common force, the behavior of friction is actually very
complicated and is still not completely understood. We have to rely heavily on
observations for whatever understandings we can gain. However, we can still deal
with its more elementary general characteristics and understand the
circumstances in which it behaves.

Friction
</div>
Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact.

</div>

One of the simpler characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the
contact surface between systems and always in a direction that opposes motion or
attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two systems are in
contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is
called **kinetic friction**{: data-type="
term" #import-auto-id1165296294917}. For example, friction slows a hockey puck
sliding on ice. But when objects are stationary, **static friction**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298806829}
can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the
kinetic friction between the objects.

Kinetic Friction
</div>
If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction.

</div>

Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor—you
may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that
the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in
the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the
crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion it is easier to
keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic
friction force is less than the static friction force. If you add mass to the
crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it
started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you
would find it to be easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you
might expect).

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298476574) is a crude pictorial representation
of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up inspection
of these surfaces shows them to be rough. So when you push to get an object
moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip
along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do
both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion.
The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on
the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due
to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which
explain the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. Adhesion
varies with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface
physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer
molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object moving. At
small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.

![The figure shows a crate on a flat surface, and a magnified view of a bottom corner of the crate and the supporting surface. The magnified view shows that there is roughness in the two surfaces in contact with each other. A black arrow points toward the right, away from the crate, and it is labeled as the direction of motion or attempted motion. A red arrow pointing toward the left is located near the bottom left corner of the crate, at the interface between that corner and the supporting surface. The red arrow is labeled as f, representing friction between the two surfaces in contact with each other.](../resources/Figure_06_01_01a.jpg "Frictional forces, such as  \( \vb{f} \) , always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. In order for the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks can skip along the bottom surface. Thus a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. Such adhesive forces also depend on the substances the surfaces are made of, explaining, for example, why rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298476574}

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (
static friction), the other for when there is motion (kinetic friction).

When there is no motion between the objects,
the **magnitude of static friction** , $$f_{s} $$ is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-70">
 $$ f_{s}\le \mu_{s}N, $$ 
</div>

where $$ \mu_{\s  } $$ is the coefficient of static friction and $$ N $$ is
the magnitude of the normal force (the force perpendicular to the surface).

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Magnitude of Static Friction
</div>
Magnitude of static friction  $$ f_{\s  } $$ is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-213">
 $$ f_{\s  }\le \mu_{\s  }N, $$ 
</div>
where  $$ \mu_{\s  } $$ is the coefficient of static friction and $$ N $$
is the magnitude of the normal force.

</div>

The symbol $$ \le $$ means *less than or equal to*, implying that static
friction can have a minimum and a maximum value of $$ \mu_{\s  }N $$. Static
friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to
whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force
exceeds $$ f_{\s  \left(\text{max}\right)} $$, the object will move. Thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-410">
 $$ f_{\s  \left(\text{max}\right)}=\mu_{\s  }N. $$ 
</div>

Once an object is moving,
the **magnitude of kinetic friction** , $$ f_k $$ is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-98">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}N, $$ 
</div>

where $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction. A system in
which $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}N $$ is described as a system in which 
*friction behaves simply*.

As seen in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298658126), the coefficients of kinetic
friction are less than their static counterparts. That values of $$ \mu $$
** in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298658126) are stated to only one or, at
most, two digits is an indication of the approximate description of friction
given by the above two equations.

The equations given earlier include the dependence of friction on materials
and the normal force. The direction of friction is always opposite that of
motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal
force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the
floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight,
$$ W=mg\left(100 \kg \right)\left(
9.80\mss \right)=980 \N  $$, perpendicular to the floor. If the
coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel
to the floor greater than $$ f_{\s  \left(\text{max}\right)}=\mu_
{\s  }N=\left(0.45\right)\left(980 \N \right)
=440\N  $$ to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and
the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290
N ( $$ f_{\text {k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}N=\left(0.30\right)\left( 980\N \right)
=290\N  $$ ) would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is
lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without
lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unit less quantity with a magnitude
usually between 0 and 1.0. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two
surfaces that are in contact.

Many people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many
parts of the body, especially the joints, have much smaller coefficients of
friction—often three or four times less than ice. A joint is formed by the ends
of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by
the lower leg bone (the tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a
ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends
of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth,
almost glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that
reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an
artificial joint ([\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296217318)). These replacements
can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium)
or plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.

![Two X-x rays of an artificial knee replacement are shown.](../resources/Figure_06_01_02a.jpg "Artificial knee replacement is a procedure that has been performed for more than 20 years. In this figure, we see the post-op x rays of the right knee joint replacement. (credit: Mike Baird, Flickr)")

Other natural lubricants include saliva produced in our mouths to aid in the
swallowing process, and the slippery mucus found between organs in the body,
allowing them to move freely past each other during heartbeats, during
breathing, and when a person moves. Artificial lubricants are also common in
hospitals and doctor’s clinics. For example, when ultrasonic imaging is carried
out, the gel that couples the transducer to the skin also serves to to lubricate
the surface between the transducer and the skin—thereby reducing the coefficient
of friction between the two surfaces. This allows the transducer to move freely
over the skin.

Skiing Exercise
</div>
A skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N.

**Strategy**

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given in to be 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is
related to the normal force $$ N $$ as $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}N $$ ;
thus, the coefficient of kinetic friction can be found if we can find the normal
force of the skier on a slope. The normal force is always perpendicular to the
surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal
force should equal the component of the skier’s weight perpendicular to the
slope. (See the skier and free-body diagram
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296217411).)

![The figure shows a skier going down a slope that forms an angle of 25 degrees with the horizontal. The weight of the skier, labeled w, is represented by a red arrow pointing vertically downward. This weight is divided into two components, w perpendicular is perpendicular to the slope, and w parallel is parallel to the slope. The normal force, labeled N, is also perpendicular to the slope, equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to w perpendicular. The friction, f, is represented by a red arrow pointing upslope. In addition, the figure shows a free body diagram that shows the relative magnitudes and directions of w, f, and N.](../resources/Figure_06_01_03a.jpg "The motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope and so it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). N (the normal force) is perpendicular to the slope, and f (the friction) is parallel to the slope, but w (the skier&#x2019;s weight) has components along both axes, namely &#10;&#10; w&#10; &#x22A5;&#10;&#10; and &#10;&#10; W&#10; //&#10;. N is equal in magnitude to w&#x22A5;, so there is no motion perpendicular to the slope. However, f is less than &#10;&#10;&#10; W// in magnitude, so there is acceleration down the slope (along the x-axis).&#10;")
{: #import-auto-id1165296217411}

That is,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-302">
 $$ N= w_{\perp }=w\cos{ 25^\circ }=mg \cos{ 25^\circ }. $$ 
</div>
Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we get

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-134">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{ 25^\circ }, $$ 
</div>
which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction  $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$ .

**Solution**

Solving for $$ \mu_{k} $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-322">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{N}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{w\cos{ 25^\circ }}=\frac{ f_{\text{k}}}{mg \cos{ 25^\circ }.} $$ 
</div>
Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-97">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{45.0 \N }{\left(62 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)\left(0.906\right)}=0.082. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298658126) for waxed wood on snow, but it is
still reasonable since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly.
In situations like this, where an object of mass $$ m $$ slides down a slope
that makes an angle $$ \theta $$ with the horizontal, friction is given by $$ f_
{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta} $$. All objects will slide down a slope
with constant acceleration under these circumstances. Proof of this is left for
this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

Take-Home Experiment

An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in [\[link\]](#fs-id1704828), the kinetic friction on a slope  $$ f_{\text{k}}=\mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta}  $$ . The component of the weight down the slope is equal to $$
mg \sin{\theta}
$$
(see the free-body diagram in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296217411)). These
forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the
acceleration is zero. Writing these out:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-387">
 $$ f_{\text{k}}={\text{Fg}}_{\text{x}} $$ 
</div>
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-368">
 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}mg \cos{\theta} =mg \sin{\theta} . $$

Solving for  $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$, we find that

 $$ \mu_{\text{k}}=\frac{mg \sin{\theta} }{mg \cos{\theta} }=\tan{\theta} . $$

Put a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find  $$ \mu_{\text{k}} $$ . Note that the coin will not start to slide at all until an angle greater than
$$ \theta $$
is attained, since the coefficient of static friction is larger than the
coefficient of kinetic friction. Discuss how this may affect the value for $$
\mu_{\text{k}} $$
and its uncertainty.

We have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a
normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple
friction is always proportional to the normal force.

Making Connections: Submicroscopic Explanations of Friction
</div>
The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of friction—they also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted (unnecessarily) to heat.

</div>

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298530900) illustrates one macroscopic
characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale)
research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but
not to the area in contact, a somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough
surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total
area since only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the
actual contact area increases, and it is found that the friction is proportional
to this area.

![This figure has two parts, each of which shows two rough surfaces in close proximity to each other. In the first part, the normal force is small, so that the area of contact between the two surfaces is much smaller than their total area. In the second part, the normal force is large, so that the area of contact between the two surfaces has increased. As a result, the friction between the two surfaces in the second part is also greater than the friction in the first part.](../resources/Figure_06_01_04a.jpg "Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When there is a greater normal force as a result of a greater applied force, the area of actual contact increases as does friction.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298530900}

But the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features
of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now being determined. In
other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially, atoms are
linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms
adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrate—essentially creating sound waves
that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with distance and their
energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional
wear can also occur between atoms and molecules on the
surfaces. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298744656) shows how the tip of a probe
drawn across another material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force
needed to drag the tip can be measured and is found to be related to shear
stress, which will be discussed later in this chapter. The variation in shear
stress is remarkable ( more than a factor of $$ 10^{12} $$ ) 
and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a
fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient
times—friction.

![This figure shows a molecular model of a probe that is dragged over the surface of a substrate. The substrate is represented by a rectangular prism, made up of a grid of small spheres, each sphere representing an atom. The probe, made up of a different grid of small spheres, is in the form of an inverted pyramid with a flattened peak. The pyramid is somewhat distorted because of friction.](../resources/Figure_06_01_05a.jpg "The tip of a probe is deformed sideways by frictional force as the probe is dragged across a surface. Measurements of how the force varies for different materials are yielding fundamental insights into the atomic nature of friction.")

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1165296328554} Friction is a contact force between systems
  that opposes the motion or attempted motion between them. Simple friction is
  proportional to the normal force $$ N $$ pushing the systems together. (A
  normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface between systems.)
  Friction depends on both of the materials involved. The magnitude of static
  friction $$ f_{\s  } $$ between systems stationary relative to one another
  is given by
  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-940">
   $$ f_{\s  }\le \mu_{\s  }N, $$ 
  </div>

  where $$ \mu_{\s  } $$ is the coefficient of static friction, which
  depends on both of the materials.

One skater pushes with a force F two, represented by an arrow pointing up, and a second skater pushes with a force F one, represented by an arrow pointing from left to right. Vector F one and vector F two are along the arms of the two skaters acting on the third skater. A vector diagram is shown in the form of a right triangle in which the base is vector F one pointing east, and perpendicular to F one is vector F two pointing north. The resultant vector is shown by the hypotenuse pointing northeast. (b) Free-body diagram showing only the forces acting on the skater.](../resources/Figure 04_01_01a.jpg)

If an object is to rest on an incline without slipping, then friction must equal the component of the weight of the object parallel to the incline. This requires greater and greater friction for steeper slopes. Show that the maximum angle of an incline above the horizontal for which an object will not slide down is  $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}{\text{μ}}_{\s  } $$ . You may use the result of the previous problem. Assume that $$ a=0 $$

**Analytical methods**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298770648} of
vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather
than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods. Part of the graphical
technique is retained, because vectors are still represented by arrows for easy
visualization. However, analytical methods are more concise, accurate, and
precise than graphical methods, which are limited by the accuracy with which a
drawing can be made. Analytical methods are limited only by the accuracy and
precision with which physical quantities are known.

### Resolving a Vector into Perpendicular Components

Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics because (
among other things) motions along perpendicular directions are independent. We
very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular components. For example,
given a vector like $$ \vb{A} $$ in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298677803), 
we may wish to find which two perpendicular vectors, $$ \vb{A}_{x} $$
and $$ \vb{A}_{y} $$, add to produce it.

![In the given figure a dotted vector A sub x is drawn from the origin along the x axis. From the head of the vector A sub x another vector A sub y is drawn in the upward direction. Their resultant vector A is drawn from the tail of the vector A sub x to the head of the vector A sub y at an angle theta from the x axis. On the graph a vector A, inclined at an angle theta with x axis is shown. Therefore vector A is the sum of the vectors A sub x and A sub y.](../resources/Figure_03_03_01a.jpg "The vector  \( A \) , with its tail at the origin of an x, y-coordinate system, is shown together with its x- and y-components,  \( A_x \)  and  \( A_y \) . 
These vectors form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors are summarized below.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298677803 height="200"}

$$ \vb{A}_{x} $$ and $$ \vb{A}_{y} $$ are defined to be the
components of $$ \vb{A} $$ along the **x**- and **y**-axes. The three
vectors $$ \vb{A} $$, $$ \vb{A}_{x} $$, and $$ \vb{A}_{y} $$
form a right triangle:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-680">
 $$ \vb{A}_{x}+ \vb{A}_{y} = \vb{A}. $$ 
</div>

Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant vector
holds only for vector quantities (which include both magnitude and direction).
The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes alone. For example, if $$
\vb{A}_{x}=3 \m  $$ east, $$ \vb{A}_{y}=4 \m 
$$ north, and $$ \vb{A}=5 \m  $$ north-east, then it is true
that the vectors $$ \vb{A}_{x} +\vb{A}_{y} =\vb{A} $$. However, it is 
**not** true that the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors is also equal. That is,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-818">
 $$ \begin{array}{}3 \m + 4 \m \ne 5 \m \\ \end{array} $$ 
</div>

Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-505">
 $$ A_x+A_y \neq A $$ 
</div>

If the vector $$ \vb{A} $$ is known, then its magnitude $$ A $$
(its length) and its angle $$ \theta $$
(its direction) are known. To find $$ A_{x} $$
 and  $$ A_{y} $$, its **x**- and **y**-components, we use the
following relationships for a right triangle.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-377">
 $$ A_{x}=A\cos{\theta}  $$ 
</div>

and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-69">
 $$ A_{y}=A\sin{\theta} . $$ 
</div>

![\]A dotted vector A sub x whose magnitude is equal to A cosine theta is drawn from the origin along the x axis. From the head of the vector A sub x another vector A sub y whose magnitude is equal to A sine theta is drawn in the upward direction. Their resultant vector A is drawn from the tail of the vector A sub x to the head of the vector A-y at an angle theta from the x axis. Therefore vector A is the sum of the vectors A sub x and A sub y.](../resources/Figure_03_03_02a.jpg "The magnitudes of the vector components  \( A_x \)  and  \( A_y \)  can be related to the resultant vector  \( A \)  and the angle \( \theta \) with trigonometric identities. Here we see that \( A_x = A \cos{\theta } \) and \( A_y=A \sin{\theta} \) .")
{: #import-auto-id1165298704788 height="225"}

Suppose, for example, that $$ \vb{A} $$ is the vector representing the total
displacement of the person walking in a city considered
in [Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](/contents/m42104)
and [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods](/contents/m42127).

![In the given figure a vector A of magnitude ten point three blocks is inclined at an angle twenty nine point one degrees to the positive x axis. The horizontal component A sub x of vector A is equal to A cosine theta which is equal to ten point three blocks multiplied to cosine twenty nine point one degrees which is equal to nine blocks east. Also the vertical component A sub y of vector A is equal to A sin theta is equal to ten point three blocks multiplied to sine twenty nine point one degrees, which is equal to five point zero blocks north.](../resources/Figure_03_03_03.jpg "We can use the relationships \( A_x=A \cos{ \theta} \) and \( A_y=A \sin{ \theta } \) to determine the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical component vectors in this example.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298544262}

Then $$ A=10.3 $$ blocks and $$ \theta =29.1^\circ $$, so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-id1646569">
 $$ A_{x}=\mag{A} \cos{\theta} =\left(10.3 \text{blocks}\right)\left(\cos{29.1^\circ }\right)=9.0 \text{blocks} $$ 
</div>

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-id2495034">
 $$ A_{y} = \mag{A} \sin{\theta} =\left(10.3 \text{blocks}\right)\left(\sin{29.1^\circ }\right)=5.0 \text{blocks}. $$ 
</div>

### Calculating a Resultant Vector

If the perpendicular components $$ \vb{A}_{x} $$ and $$ \vb{A}_{y}
$$ of a vector $$ \vb{A} $$ are known, then $$ \vb{A} $$ can also be
found analytically. To find the magnitude $$ A $$ and direction $$ \theta $$ of
a vector from its perpendicular components $$ \vb{A}_{x} $$ and $$
\vb{A}_{y} $$, we use the following relationships:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-109">
 $$ A=\sqrt{ A_x^2+ A_y^2} $$ 
</div>

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-750">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1} \left( \frac{ A_{y}}{ A_{x}} \right). $$ 
</div>

![Vector A is shown with its horizontal and vertical components A sub x and A sub y respectively. The magnitude of vector A is equal to the square root of A sub x squared plus A sub y squared. The angle theta of the vector A with the x axis is equal to inverse tangent of A sub y over A sub x](../resources/Figure_03_03_04a.jpg "The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector  can be determined once the horizontal and vertical components, \( \vb{A}_x \) and \( \vb{A}_y \) have been determined.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298723894}

Note that the equation $$ A=\sqrt{ A_{x}^{2}+ A_{y}^{2}} $$ is just the
Pythagorean theorem relating the legs of a right triangle to the length of the
hypotenuse. For example, if $$ A_{x} $$ and $$ A_{y} $$ are 9 and 5 blocks,
respectively, then $$ A=\sqrt{ 9^{2}+5^{2}}=10.3 $$ blocks, again consistent
with the example of the person walking in a city. Finally, the direction is $$
\theta ={\tan}^{–1}\left(5/9 \right) =29.1^\circ $$, as before.

Determining Vectors and Vector Components with Analytical Methods
</div>
Equations  $$ A_{x}=A\cos{\theta}  $$ and $$ A_{y}=A\sin{\theta} $$
are used to find the perpendicular components of a vector—that is, to go from
$$ A $$ and $$ \theta $$ to $$ A_{x} $$ and $$ A_{y} $$. 
Equations $$ A=\sqrt{ A_{x}^{2}+ A_{y}^{2}} $$
and $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1} \left( \frac{ A_{y}}{ A_{x}} \right) $$
are used to find a vector from its perpendicular components—that is, to go from
$$ A_{x} $$ and $$ A_{y} $$ to $$ A $$ and $$ \theta $$.

### Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods

To see how to add vectors using perpendicular components,
consider [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298839640), in which the vectors $$
\vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$ are added to produce the resultant $$
\vb{R} $$.

![Two vectors A and B are shown. The tail of vector B is at the head of vector A and the tail of the vector A is at origin. Both the vectors are in the first quadrant. The resultant R of these two vectors extending from the tail of vector A to the head of vector B is also shown.](../resources/Figure_03_03_05a.jpg "Vectors  \( A \)  and  \( B \)  are two legs of a walk, and  \( R \)  is the resultant or total displacement. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of  \( R \) .")
{: #import-auto-id1165298839640}

If $$ \vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$ represent two legs of a walk (two
displacements), then $$ \vb{R} $$ is the total displacement. The person
taking the walk ends up at the tip of $$ \vb{R}$$. There are many ways to
arrive at the same point. In particular, the person could have walked first in
the *x*-direction and then in the *y*-direction. Those paths are the *x*- and 
*y*-components of the resultant, $$ \vb{R}_{x} $$ and $$ \vb{R}_{y}
$$. If we know $$ \vb{R}_{x} $$ and $$ \vb{R}_{y} $$, we can
find $$ R $$ and $$ \theta $$ using the equations $$ A=\sqrt{ A_{x}^{2}+ A_
{y}^{2}} $$ and $$ \theta ={\tan}^{–1}\left( A_{y}/ A_{x}\right) $$. When you
use the analytical method of vector addition, you can determine the components
or the magnitude and direction of a vector.

***Step 1.*** *Identify the x- and y-axes that will be used in the problem.
Then, find the components of each vector to be added along the chosen
perpendicular axes.* Use the equations $$ A_{x}=A\cos{\theta} $$ and $$ A_
{y}=A\sin{\theta} $$ to find the components.
In [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296674934), these components are $$ A_{x} $$,
$$ A_{y} $$, $$ B_{x} $$, and $$ B_{y} $$. The angles that vectors $$ \vb{A}
$$ and $$ \vb{B} $$ make with the **x**-axis are $$ \theta_{\text{A}} $$ and
$$ \theta_{\text{B}} $$, respectively.

![Two vectors A and B are shown. The tail of the vector B is at the head of vector A and the tail of the vector A is at origin. Both the vectors are in the first quadrant. The resultant R of these two vectors extending from the tail of vector A to the head of vector B is also shown. The horizontal and vertical components of the vectors A and B are shown with the help of dotted lines. The vectors labeled as A sub x and A sub y are the components of vector A, and B sub x and B sub y as the components of vector B..](../resources/Figure_03_03_06a.jpg "To add vectors  \( A \)  and  \( B \) , first determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector. These are the dotted vectors  \( A_x \) ,  \( A_y \) ,  \( B_x \)  and   \( B_y \)  shown in the image.")
{: #import-auto-id1165296674934}

***Step 2.*** *Find the components of the resultant along each axis by adding
the components of the individual vectors along that axis.* That is, as
shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298866862),

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-284">
 $$ R_{x}= A_{x}+B_{x} $$ 
</div>

and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-92">
 $$ R_{y}= A_{y}+B_{y}. $$ 
</div>

![Two vectors A and B are shown. The tail of vector B is at the head of vector A and the tail of the vector A is at origin. Both the vectors are in the first quadrant. The resultant R of these two vectors extending from the tail of vector A to the head of vector B is also shown. The vectors A and B are resolved into the horizontal and vertical components shown as dotted lines parallel to x axis and y axis respectively. The horizontal components of vector A and vector B are labeled as A sub x and B sub x and the horizontal component of the resultant R is labeled at R sub x and is equal to A sub x plus B sub x. The vertical components of vector A and vector B are labeled as A sub y and B sub y and the vertical components of the resultant R is labeled as R sub y is equal to A sub y plus B sub y.](../resources/Figure_03_03_07a.jpg "The magnitude of the vectors  \( A_x \)  and  \( B_x \)  add to give the magnitude  \( R_x \)  of the resultant vector in the horizontal direction. Similarly, the magnitudes of the vectors  \( A_y \)  and   \( B_y \)  add to give the magnitude  \( R_y \)  of the resultant vector in the vertical direction.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298866862}

Components along the same axis, say the **x**-axis, are vectors along the same
line and, thus, can be added to one another like ordinary numbers. The same is
true for components along the **y**-axis. (For example, a 9-block eastward walk
could be taken in two legs, the first 3 blocks east and the second 6 blocks
east, for a total of 9, because they are along the same direction.) So resolving
vectors into components along common axes makes it easier to add them. Now that
the components of $$ \vb{R} $$ are known, its magnitude and direction can be
found.

***Step 3.*** *To get the magnitude $$ R $$ of the resultant, use the
Pythagorean theorem:*

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-960">
$$ R=\sqrt{ R_{x}^{2}+R_{y}^{2}}. $$ 
</div>

***Step 4.*** *To get the direction of the resultant:*

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-173">
$$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1} \left( R_{y}/R_{x} \right). $$ 
</div>

The following example illustrates this technique for adding vectors using
perpendicular components.

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods
</div>
Add the vector  $$ \vb{A} $$ to the vector $$ \vb{B} $$
shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296662297), using perpendicular
components along the **x**- and **y**-axes. The **x**- and **y**-axes are along
the east–west and north–south directions, respectively. Vector $$ \vb{A}
$$
represents the first leg of a walk in which a person walks $$ 53.0 \m  $$
in a direction $$ 20.0^\circ $$
north of east. Vector $$ \vb{B} $$
represents the second leg, a displacement of $$ 34.0 \m  $$
in a direction $$ 63.0^\circ $$
north of east.

![Two vectors A and B are shown. The tail of the vector A is at origin. Both the vectors are in the first quadrant. Vector A is of magnitude fifty three units and is inclined at an angle of twenty degrees to the horizontal. From the head of the vector A another vector B of magnitude 34 units is drawn and is inclined at angle sixty three degrees with the horizontal. The resultant of two vectors is drawn from the tail of the vector A to the head of the vector B.](../resources/Figure_03_03_08a.jpg "Vector  \( A \)  has magnitude 53.0 m and direction 20.0 degrees north of the x-axis. Vector  \( B \)  has magnitude 34.0 m and direction 63.0 degrees north of the x-axis. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of  \( R \) .")
{: #import-auto-id1165296662297}

**Strategy**

The components of $$ \vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$ along the **x**- and 
**y**-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same ending
point. Once found, they are combined to produce the resultant.

**Solution**

Following the method outlined above, we first find the components of $$
\vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$ along the **x**- and **y**-axes. Note that $$
A=53.0 \m  $$, $$ \theta_{\text{A}}=20.0^\circ $$, $$ B=34.0 \m  $$,
and $$ \theta_{\text{B}}=63.0^\circ $$. We find the **x**-components by using $$
A_{x}=A\cos{\theta} $$, which gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-253">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll} 
A_{x}& =& A\cos{\theta_{A}}=\left(53.0 \m \right) \left(\cos{20.0^\circ}\right)\\
 & =& \left(53.0 \m \right)\left(0.940 \right)=49.8 \m
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-356">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll} 
B_{x}& =& B\cos{\theta_{B}}=\left(34.0 \m \right) \left(\cos{63.0^\circ}\right)\\ 
& =& \left(34.0 \m \right)\left(0.454\right)=15.4 \m .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
Similarly, the *y*-components are found using  $$ A_{y}=A\sin{\theta_{A}} $$ :

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-802">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll} 
A_{y}& =& A\sin{\theta_{A}}=\left(53.0 \m \right) \left(\sin{20.0^\circ }\right)\\ 
& =& \left(53.0 \m \right)\left(0.342\right)=18.1 \m 
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-837">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll} 
B_{y}& =& B\sin{\theta_{B}}=\left(34.0 \m \right)\left(\sin{ 63.0^\circ}\right)\\
& = &\left(34.0 \m \right)\left(0.891\right)=30.3 \m .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
The **x**- and **y**-components of the resultant are thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-196">
 $$  R_{x}= A_{x}+B_{x}=49.8 \m +15.4 \m =65.2 \m  $$ 
</div>
and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-325">
 $$  R_{y}= A_{y}+B_{y}=18.1 \m  +30.3 \m =48.4  \m . $$ 
</div>
Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-941">
 $$ R=\sqrt{ R_{x}^{2}+R_{y}^{2} }=
\sqrt{ \left( 65.2 \m  \right)^{2}+\left(48.4 \m  \right)^{2} } $$ 
</div>
so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-702">
 $$ R=81.2 \m  $$ 
</div>
Finally, we find the direction of the resultant:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-713">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left( \frac{ R_{y}}{R_{x}} \right)= +{\tan}^{-1}\left( \frac{48.4 \m}{65.2\m}\right) . $$ 
</div>
Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-755">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(0.742\right)=36.6^\circ . $$ 
</div>
![The addition of two vectors A and B is shown. Vector A is of magnitude fifty three units and is inclined at an angle of twenty degrees to the horizontal.

The components of vector B are also shown as dotted vectors B X is equal to fifteen point four meter and B Y is equal to thirty point three meter. The horizontal component of the resultant R X is equal to A X plus B X is equal to sixty five point two meter.

The direction of the resultant R is in thirty six point six degree from the vector A in anticlockwise direction.](../resources/Figure_03_03_09a.jpg "Using analytical methods, we see that the magnitude of  \( R \)  is 81.2 m and its direction is 36.6 degrees north of east."){: #import-auto-id1165298804108}

**Discussion**

This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular components.
Vector subtraction using perpendicular components is very similar—it is just the
addition of a negative vector.

Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative vector.
That is, $$ \vb{A}-\vb{B}\equiv \vb{A}+\left( -\vb{B} \right) $$.
Thus, *the method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicular components
is identical to that for addition*. The components of $$ -\vb{B} $$
are the negatives of the components of $$ \vb{B} $$. The *x*- and **y**
-components of the resultant $$ \vb{A}-\vb{B} = \vb{R} $$ are thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-772">
 $$  R_{x}= A_{x}+\left(– B_{x}\right) $$ 
</div>
and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-532">
 $$  R_{y}= A_{y}+\left(– B_{y}\right) $$ 
</div>
and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298841604).)

</div>

Analyzing vectors using perpendicular components is very useful in many areas of
physics, because perpendicular quantities are often independent of one another.
The next module, [Projectile Motion](/contents/m42042), is one of many in which
using perpendicular components helps make the picture clear and simplifies the
physics.

* {: #import-auto-id1165296238492} The steps to add vectors $$ \vb{A} $$ and

Solve the following problem using analytical techniques: Suppose you walk 18.0 m straight west and then 25.0 m straight north. How far are you from your starting point, and what is the compass direction of a line connecting your starting point to your final position? 
(If you represent the two legs of the walk as vector displacements  $$ \vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$, as in [[link]](#import-auto-id1165298935750), then this problem asks you to
find their sum $$
\vb{R}=\vb{A}+\vb{B} $$.)

Repeat [[link]](#eip-287) using analytical techniques, but reverse the order of the two legs of the walk and show that you get the same final result.

Interference is the hallmark of waves, all of which exhibit constructive and
destructive interference exactly analogous to that seen for water waves. In
fact, one way to prove something “is a wave” is to observe interference effects.
So, sound being a wave, we expect it to exhibit interference; we have already
mentioned a few such effects, such as the beats from two similar notes played
simultaneously.

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise.
Larger-scale applications of active noise reduction by destructive interference
are contemplated for entire passenger compartments in commercial aircraft. To
obtain destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a
second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the
incoming noise. Sound waves in fluids are pressure waves and consistent with
Pascal’s principle; pressures from two different sources add and subtract like
simple numbers; that is, positive and negative gauge pressures add to a much
smaller pressure, producing a lower-intensity sound. Although completely
destructive interference is possible only under the simplest conditions, it is
possible to reduce noise levels by 30 dB or more using this technique.

![A detailed picture of headphones with all its parts labeled. It shows the noise cancellation system in both the ear plugs consisting of the noise sensor, driver, pressure servo and cushions. There is a boom mic with low frequency housing, a boom adjustment, boom and cable all attached to one side of the power input cable. The power input cable is shown to have an on/off switch.](../resources/Figure_18_05_02a.jpg "Headphones designed to cancel noise with destructive interference create a sound wave exactly opposite to the incoming sound. These headphones can be more effective than the simple passive attenuation used in most ear protection. Such headphones were used on the record-setting, around the world nonstop flight of the Voyager aircraft to protect the pilots&#x2019; hearing from engine noise.")
{: #Figure1}

Where else can we observe sound interference? All sound resonances, such as in
musical instruments, are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only
the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while
others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing
over a bottle, to the characteristic flavor of a violin’s sounding box, to the
recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and standing waves play a
vital role.

Interference
</div>
Interference is such a fundamental aspect of waves that observing interference is proof that something is a wave. The wave nature of light was established by experiments showing interference. Similarly, when electrons scattered from crystals exhibited interference, their wave nature was confirmed to be exactly as predicted by symmetry with certain wave characteristics of light.

Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other
end, as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)
, [[Figure 4]](#Figure4), and [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). If the tuning fork has
just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at
most frequencies it vibrates very little. This observation just means that the
air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a
resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance
travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If
the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the
tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with
the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected
sounds form a standing wave in the tube as shown.

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork with right arm of fork moving right and left arm moving left. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves moving across a tube from the open end to the closed end. The tip of the cone is at the open end of the tube.](../resources/Figure_18_05_03aa.jpg "Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A disturbance moves down the tube.")
{: #Figure2}

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube. The tip of the cone is at the closed end of the tube, and the mouth of the cone is moving toward the open end of the tube.](../resources/Figure_18_05_03ab.jpg "Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. The disturbance reflects from the closed end of the tube.")

If the length of the tube \( L \) is just right, the disturbance gets back to the tuning fork half a cycle later and interferes constructively with the continuing sound from the tuning fork. This interference forms a standing wave, and the air column resonates.")
{: #Figure4}

![The right side shows a vibrating tuning fork with its right arm moving rightward and left arm moving leftward. The left side shows a cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube. The curve side of the cone has reached the tuning fork. The length of the tube is given to be equal to lambda divided by four.](../resources/Figure_18_05_03ac.jpg "Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A graph of air displacement along the length of the tube shows none at the closed end, where the motion is constrained, and a maximum at the open end. This standing wave has one-fourth of its wavelength in the tube, so that \( \lambda =4L \).")
{: #Figure5}

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an **
antinode**) at the open end, where motion is unconstrained, and no
displacement (a **node**) at the closed end, where air movement is halted. The
distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this
equals the length of the tube; thus, $$\lambda =4L $$ . This same resonance can
be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as
shown in [[Figure 6]](#Figure6). It is best to consider this a natural vibration
of the air column independently of how it is induced.

![A cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube is shown. A tuning fork is shown to vibrate at a small opening above the closed end of the tube. The length of the tube L is given to be equal to lambda divided by four.](../resources/Figure_18_05_04ab.jpg "The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end. ")
{: #Figure6}

Given that maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at
the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the
tube, such as the one shown in [[Figure 7]](#Figure7). Here the standing wave
has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or $$L=\left(3/4\right)
\lambda^{\prime} $$ , so that $$\lambda^{\prime} =4L/3 $$ . Continuing this
process reveals a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds
that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms for the resonances in any
system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the **fundamental**, while all
higher resonant frequencies are called **overtones**. All resonant frequencies
are integral multiples of the fundamental, and they are collectively called **
harmonics**. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the
second harmonic, and so on. [[Figure 8]](#Figure8) shows the fundamental and the
first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end.

![A cone of resonance waves reflected at the closed end of the tube is shown as a wave. There is three-fourth of the wave inside the tube and one-fourth outside shown as dotted curve. The length of the tube is given as three-fourth times lambda prime.](../resources/Figure_18_05_05aa.jpg "Another resonance for a tube closed at one end. This has maximum air displacements at the open end, and none at the closed end. The wavelength is shorter, with three-fourths \( \lambda^\prime\) equaling the length of the tube, so that \( \lambda^\prime =4L/3 \) . This higher-frequency vibration is the first overtone.")
{: #Figure7}

![There are four tubes, each of which is closed at one end. Each tube has resonance waves reflected at the closed end. In the first tube, marked Fundamental, the wavelength is long and only one-fourth of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the second tube, marked First overtone, the wavelength is slightly shorter and three-fourths of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the third tube, marked Second overtone, the wavelength is still shorter and one and one-fourth of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end. In the fourth tube, marked Third overtone, the wavelength is shorter than the others, and one and three-fourths of the wave is inside the tube, with the maximum air displacement at the open end.](../resources/Figure_18_05_06a.jpg "The fundamental and three lowest overtones for a tube closed at one end. All have maximum air displacements at the open end and none at the closed end.")
{: #Figure8}

The fundamental and overtones can be present simultaneously in a variety of
combinations. For example, middle C on a trumpet has a sound distinctively
different from middle C on a clarinet, both instruments being modified versions
of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually
the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different
and subject to shading by the musician. This mix is what gives various musical
instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they
have air columns, strings, sounding boxes, or drumheads. In fact, much of our
speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and
positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.
Simple resonant cavities can be made to resonate with the sound of the vowels,
for example. (See [[Figure 9]](#Figure9).) In boys, at puberty, the larynx grows
and the shape of the resonant cavity changes giving rise to the difference in
predominant frequencies in speech between men and women.

![Two pictures of the throat and mouth in cross-section are shown. The first picture has parts of the mouth and throat labeled. The first picture shows the position of the mouth and tongue when producing an a a a sound, and the second picture shows the position of the mouth and tongue when producing an e e e sound.](../resources/Figure_18_05_07a.jpg "The throat and mouth form an air column closed at one end that resonates in response to vibrations in the voice box. The spectrum of overtones and their intensities vary with mouth shaping and tongue position to form different sounds. The voice box can be replaced with a mechanical vibrator, and understandable speech is still possible. Variations in basic shapes make different voices recognizable.")
{: #Figure9}

Now let us look for a pattern in the resonant frequencies for a simple tube that
is closed at one end. The fundamental has $$\lambda =4L $$ , and frequency is
related to wavelength and the speed of sound as given by:

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{w}=f\lambda . $$
</div>

Solving for $$f $$ in this equation gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$f=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{\lambda }=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}, $$
</div>

where $${v}_{w} $$ is the speed of sound in air. Similarly, the first overtone
has $$\lambda^{\prime} =4L/3 $$
(see [[Figure 8]](#Figure8)), so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$f^{\prime}=3\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}=3f. $$
</div>

Because $$f^{\prime}=3f $$ , we call the first overtone the third harmonic.
Continuing this process, we see a pattern that can be generalized in a single
expression. The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}\text{,} n=1,3,5\text{,} $$
</div>

where $${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental, $${f}_{3} $$ is the first overtone, and
so on. It is interesting that the resonant frequencies depend on the speed of
sound and, hence, on temperature. This dependence poses a noticeable problem for
organs in old unheated cathedrals, and it is also the reason why musicians
commonly bring their wind instruments to room temperature before playing them.

Find the Length of a Tube with a 128 Hz Fundamental
</div>
(a) What length should a tube closed at one end have on a day when the air temperature, is  $$22.0ºC $$ ,
 if its fundamental frequency is to be 128 Hz (C below middle C)?

(b) What is the frequency of its fourth overtone?

<strong> Strategy</strong>

The length $$L $$ can be found from the relationship in $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_
{w}}{4L} $$ , but we will first need to find the speed of sound $${v}_{w} $$.

**Solution for (a)**

(1) Identify knowns:

* the fundamental frequency is 128 Hz
* the air temperature is $$22.0ºC $$
  (2) Use $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L} $$ to find the fundamental frequency (
  $$n=1 $$ ).

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{1}=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L} $$
</div>
(3) Solve this equation for length.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {4f}_{1}} $$
</div>
(4) Find the speed of sound using  $${v}_{w}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{T}{273 \text{K}}} $$ .

<div class="equation" >
 $${v}_{w}=\left(331 \text{m/s}\right)\sqrt{\frac{295 \text{K}}{273 \text{K}}}=344 \text{m/s} $$
</div>
(5) Enter the values of the speed of sound and frequency into the expression for  $$L $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$L=\frac{ {v}_{w}}{ {4f}_{1}}=\frac{344 \text{m/s}}{4\left(128 \text{Hz}\right)}=0.672 \text{m} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (a)**

Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and
other devices for changing the length of the resonating air column and hence,
the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies, such as
tubas, require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops.

**Solution for (b)**

(1) Identify knowns:

* the first overtone has $$n=3 $$
* the second overtone has $$n=5 $$
* the third overtone has $$n=7 $$
* the fourth overtone has $$n=9 $$
  (2) Enter the value for the fourth overtone into $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_
  {w}}{4L} $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{9}=9\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}={9f}_{1}=1.15 \text{kHz} $$
</div>
**Discussion on (b)**

Whether this overtone occurs in a simple tube or a musical instrument depends on
how it is stimulated to vibrate and the details of its shape. The trombone, for
example, does not produce its fundamental frequency and only makes overtones.

</div>

Another type of tube is one that is *open* at both ends. Examples are some organ
pipes, flutes, and oboes. The resonances of tubes open at both ends can be
analyzed in a very similar fashion to those for tubes closed at one end. The air
columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air displacements at both ends,
as illustrated in [[Figure 10]](#Figure10). Standing waves form as shown.

![The resonant frequency waves in a tube open at both ends are shown. There are a set of four images. The first image shows a tube of length L marked fundamental having half a wave. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The second image shows a tube of length L marked first over tone having a full wave. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The third image shows a tube of length L marked second over tone having a full wave and a half. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube. The fourth image shows a tube of length L marked third over tone having two full waves. The maxima of the vibrations are on both the open ends of the tube.](../resources/Figure_18_05_08a.jpg "The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one end.")
{: #Figure10}

Based on the fact that a tube open at both ends has maximum air displacements at
both ends, and using [[Figure 10]](#Figure10) as a guide, we can see that the
resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are:

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{2L}, n=1, 2, 3\text{...,} $$
</div>

where $${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental, $${f}_{2} $$ is the first overtone,
$${f}_{3} $$ is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at both
ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end.
It also has a different spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end. So
if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at
both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when
played because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example, would sound
richer played on an open tube, because it has even multiples of the fundamental
as well as odd. A closed tube has only odd multiples.

Real-World Applications: Resonance in Everyday Systems
</div>
Resonance occurs in many different systems, including strings, air columns, and atoms. Resonance is the driven or forced oscillation of a system at its natural frequency. At resonance, energy is transferred rapidly to the oscillating system, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows until the system can no longer be described by Hooke’s law. An example of this is the distorted sound intentionally produced in certain types of rock music.

</div>

Wind instruments use resonance in air columns to amplify tones made by lips or
vibrating reeds. Other instruments also use air resonance in clever ways to
amplify sound. [[Figure 11]](#Figure11) shows a violin and a guitar, both of
which have sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different
overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a sound that resonates in the
sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the
instrument its characteristic flavor. The more complex the shape of the sounding
box, the greater its ability to resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The
marimba, like the one shown in [[Figure 12]](#Figure12) uses pots or gourds
below the wooden slats to amplify their tones. The resonance of the pot can be
adjusted by adding water.

![First photograph is of a person playing the guitar and the second photograph is of a violin.](../resources/Figure_18_05_09a.jpg "String instruments such as violins and guitars use resonance in their sounding boxes to amplify and enrich the sound created by their vibrating strings.

{: #Figure11}

![Photograph of two people playing a marimba with gourds as resonance chambers.](../resources/Figure_18_05_10a.jpg "Resonance has been used in musical instruments since prehistoric times. This marimba uses gourds as resonance chambers to amplify its sound. (credit: APC Events, Flickr)")
{: #Figure12}

We have emphasized sound applications in our discussions of resonance and
standing waves, but these ideas apply to any system that has wave
characteristics. Vibrating strings, for example, are actually resonating and
have fundamentals and overtones similar to those for air columns. More subtle
are the resonances in atoms due to the wave character of their electrons. Their
orbitals can be viewed as standing waves, which have a fundamental (ground
state) and overtones (excited states). It is fascinating that wave
characteristics apply to such a wide range of physical systems.

### Section Summary

* Sound interference and resonance have the same properties as defined for all
  waves.
* In air columns, the lowest-frequency resonance is called the fundamental,
  whereas all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. Collectively,
  they are called harmonics.
* The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end are:

  <div class="equation" >
   $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{4L}\text{, }n=1, 3, 5\text{...}, $$
  </div>

$${f}_{1} $$ is the fundamental and $$L $$ is the length of the tube.

* The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are:

  <div class="equation" >
   $${f}_{n}=n\frac{ {v}_{w}}{2L}\text{, }n=1, 2, 3\text{...} $$

A crude approximation of voice production is to consider the breathing passages and mouth to be a resonating tube closed at one end. (See [[Figure 9]](#Figure9).) (a) What is the fundamental frequency if the tube is 0.240-m long, by taking air temperature to be  $$37.0ºC $$ ?
 (b) What would this frequency become if the person replaced the air with helium? Assume the same temperature dependence for helium as for air.

(a) Students in a physics lab are asked to find the length of an air column in a tube closed at one end that has a fundamental frequency of 256 Hz. They hold the tube vertically and fill it with water to the top, then lower the water while a 256-Hz tuning fork is rung and listen for the first resonance. What is the air temperature if the resonance occurs for a length of 0.336 m? (b) At what length will they observe the second resonance (first overtone)?

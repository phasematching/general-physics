When light strikes materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called
the **photoelectric effect**, meaning that light (*photo*) produces electricity.
One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those
that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras. In a similar way,
another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have
seen on a roof top or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric
effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices.

![An image of a vacuum tube is shown.](../resources/Figure 30_02_01a.jpg "The photoelectric effect can be observed by allowing light to fall on the metal plate in this evacuated tube. Electrons ejected by the light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the collector wire and plate can then be adjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. For example, if it is sufficiently negative, no electrons will reach the wire. (credit: P.P. Urone)")
{: #Figure1}

This effect has been known for more than a century and can be studied using a
device such as that shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). This figure shows an
evacuated tube with a metal plate and a collector wire that are connected by a
variable voltage source, with the collector more negative than the plate. When
light (or other EM radiation) strikes the plate in the evacuated tube, it may
eject electrons. If the electrons have energy in electron volts (eV) greater
than the potential difference between the plate and the wire in volts, some
electrons will be collected on the wire. Since the electron energy in eV is $$qV
$$ , where $$q $$ is the electron charge and $$V $$ is the potential difference,
the electron energy can be measured by adjusting the retarding voltage between
the wire and the plate. The voltage that stops the electrons from reaching the
wire equals the energy in eV. For example, if $$-3.00 \text{V} $$ barely stops
the electrons, their energy is 3.00 eV. The number of electrons ejected can be
determined by measuring the current between the wire and plate. The more light,
the more electrons; a little circuitry allows this device to be used as a light
meter.

What is really important about the photoelectric effect is what Albert Einstein
deduced from it. Einstein realized that there were several characteristics of
the photoelectric effect that could be explained only if *EM radiation is itself
quantized*\: the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is
actually composed of energy quanta called photons. In his explanation of the
photoelectric effect, Einstein defined a quantized unit or quantum of EM energy,
which we now call a **photon**, with an energy proportional to the frequency of
EM radiation. In equation form, the **photon energy** is

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf, $$
</div>

where $$E $$ is the energy of a photon of frequency $$f $$ and $$h $$ is
Planck’s constant. This revolutionary idea looks similar to Planck’s
quantization of energy states in blackbody oscillators, but it is quite
different. It is the quantization of EM radiation itself. EM waves are composed
of photons and are not continuous smooth waves as described in previous chapters
on optics. Their energy is absorbed and emitted in lumps, not continuously. This
is exactly consistent with Planck’s quantization of energy levels in blackbody
oscillators, since these oscillators increase and decrease their energy in steps
of $$ hf $$ by absorbing and emitting photons having $$E= hf $$ . We do not
observe this with our eyes, because there are so many photons in common light
sources that individual photons go unnoticed. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) The
next section of the
text ([Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum](/m42563)) is devoted to
a discussion of photons and some of their characteristics and implications. For
now, we will use the photon concept to explain the photoelectric effect, much as
Einstein did.

![Light rays coming out of a flashlight. The photons are depicted as small ellipses enclosing a wave each and moving in the direction of the rays. Energies of photons are labeled as E and E prime, where E is equal to h f and E prime is equal to h f prime.](../resources/Figure 30_02_02a.jpg "An EM wave of frequency \( f \) is composed of photons, or individual quanta of EM radiation. The energy of each photon is \( E=hf \), where \( h \) is Planck&#x2019;s constant and \( f \) is the frequency of the EM radiation. Higher intensity means more photons per unit area. The flashlight emits large numbers of photons of many different frequencies, hence others have energy \( E{^\prime}=hf{^\prime} \), and so on. ")
{: #Figure2}

The photoelectric effect has the properties discussed below. All these
properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation
are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining
the photon’s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea
that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens
with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy $$ hf
$$.

1. If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a material, we find
   the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency $${f}_{0}
   $$     
   for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of
   intensity. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the
   photon energy is too small to break an electron away, no electrons will be
   ejected. If EM radiation was a simple wave, sufficient energy could be
   obtained by increasing the intensity.
2. *Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay*.
   As soon as an individual photon of a sufficiently high frequency is absorbed
   by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were
   a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be
   deposited to the metal surface to eject an electron.
3. The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the
   intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity
   EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all
   photons having the same characteristic energy $$ hf $$ .

4. If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of
   ejected electrons, we find the following: *The maximum kinetic energy of
   ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation*. Since
   there are so many electrons in a material, it is extremely unlikely that two
   photons will interact with the same electron at the same time, thereby
   increasing the energy given it. Instead (as noted in 3 above), increased
   intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM
   radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could give more energy, and
   higher-energy electrons would be ejected.
5. The kinetic energy of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the
   binding energy of the electron in the specific material. An individual photon
   can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon’s energy is partly used
   to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the
   ejected electron’s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given by
   <div class="equation" >
   $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf-\text{BE}, $$
   </div>

   where $${\text{KE}}_{e} $$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected
   electron, $$ hf $$ is the photon’s energy, and BE is the **binding energy**
   of the electron to the particular material. (BE is sometimes called the *work
   function* of the material.) This equation, due to Einstein in 1905, explains
   the properties of the photoelectric effect quantitatively. An individual
   photon of EM radiation (it does not come any other way) interacts with an
   individual electron, supplying enough energy, BE, to break it away, with the
   remainder going to kinetic energy. The binding energy is $$\text{BE}=hf_{0}
   $$ , where $${f}_{0} $$ is the threshold frequency for the particular
   material. [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a graph of maximum $${\text{KE}}_{e}
   $$     
   versus the frequency of incident EM radiation falling on a particular
   material.

![A graph of frequency verses kinetic energy of an electron is shown, where frequency is along x axis and kinetic energy is along the y axis. The plot is a straight line having an inclination with x axis and meets the x axis at f sub zero, known as threshold frequency, given by B E divided by h. The threshold kinetic energy is written as equal to h f minus B E.](../resources/Figure 30_02_03a.jpg "Photoelectric effect. A graph of the kinetic energy of an ejected electron, \( \text{KE}_\text{e} \), versus the frequency of EM radiation impinging on a certain material. There is a threshold frequency below which no electrons are ejected, because the individual photon interacting with an individual electron has insufficient energy to break it away. Above the threshold energy, \( \text{KE}_\text{e} \) increases linearly with \( f \) , consistent with \( \text{KE}_\text{e}=hf -\text{BE} \). The slope of this line is \( h \) &#x2014;the data can be used to determine Planck&#x2019;s constant experimentally. Einstein gave the first successful explanation of such data by proposing the idea of photons&#x2014;quanta of EM radiation.  ")
{: #Figure3}

Einstein’s idea that EM radiation is quantized was crucial to the beginnings of
quantum mechanics. It is a far more general concept than its explanation of the
photoelectric effect might imply. All EM radiation can also be modeled in the
form of photons, and the characteristics of EM radiation are entirely consistent
with this fact. (As we will see in the next section, many aspects of EM
radiation, such as the hazards of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, can be explained *
only* by photon properties.) More famous for modern relativity, Einstein planted
an important seed for quantum mechanics in 1905, the same year he published his
first paper on special relativity. His explanation of the photoelectric effect
was the basis for the Nobel Prize awarded to him in 1921. Although his other
contributions to theoretical physics were also noted in that award, special and
general relativity were not fully recognized in spite of having been partially
verified by experiment by 1921. Although hero-worshipped, this great man never
received Nobel recognition for his most famous work—relativity.

Calculating Photon Energy and the Photoelectric Effect: A Violet Light
</div>
(a) What is the energy in joules and electron volts of a photon of 420-nm violet light? (b) What is the maximum kinetic energy of electrons ejected from calcium by 420-nm violet light, given that the binding energy (or work function) of electrons for calcium metal is 2.71 eV?

**Strategy**

To solve part (a), note that the energy of a photon is given by $$E= hf $$ . For
part (b), once the energy of the photon is calculated, it is a straightforward
application of $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE} $$ to find the ejected
electron’s maximum kinetic energy, since BE is given.

**Solution for (a)**

Photon energy is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf $$
</div>
Since we are given the wavelength rather than the frequency, we solve the familiar relationship  $$c=f\lambda  $$  for the frequency, yielding

<div class="equation" >
 $$f=\frac{c}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Combining these two equations gives the useful relationship

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Now substituting known values yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{\left( 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{J}\cdot \text{s}\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)}{420 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}}=4.74 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}. $$
</div>
Converting to eV, the energy of the photon is

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left( 4.74 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}\right)\frac{1 \text{eV}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}}=2.96 \text{eV}. $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

Finding the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is now a simple application
of the equation $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE} $$ . Substituting the photon
energy and binding energy yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf- \text{BE}=2.96 \text{eV} - 2.71 \text{eV}=0.246 \text{eV}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The energy of this 420-nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule,
and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense
directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking
at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy
to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of
energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order
of eV, so that the UV photon in this example could have biological effects. The
ejected electron (called a *photoelectron*) has a rather low energy, and it
would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a
retarding potential of but 0.26 eV. In fact, if the photon wavelength were
longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative
kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420-nm photons with
their 2.96-eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can show
for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 459 nm (blue light). This means
that if calcium metal is used in a light meter, the meter will be insensitive to
wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be
completely insensitive to red light, for example.

### Section Summary

* The photoelectric effect is the process in which EM radiation ejects electrons
  from a material.
* Einstein proposed photons to be quanta of EM radiation having energy $$E= hf
  $$ , where $$f $$ is the frequency of the radiation.
* All EM radiation is composed of photons. As Einstein explained, all
  characteristics of the photoelectric effect are due to the interaction of
  individual photons with individual electrons.
* The maximum kinetic energy $${\text{KE}}_{e} $$ of ejected electrons (
  photoelectrons) is given by $${\text{KE}}_{e}= hf\text{- BE} $$ , where $$ hf
  $$ is the photon energy and BE is the binding energy (or work function) of the
  electron to the particular material.

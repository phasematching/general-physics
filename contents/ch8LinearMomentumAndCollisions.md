We use the term momentum in various ways in everyday language, and most of these
ways are consistent with its precise scientific definition. We speak of sports
teams or politicians gaining and maintaining the momentum to win. We also
recognize that momentum has something to do with collisions. For example,
looking at the rugby players in the photograph colliding and falling to the
ground, we expect their momenta to have great effects in the resulting
collisions. Generally, momentum implies a tendency to continue on course—to move
in the same direction—and is associated with great mass and speed.

Momentum, like energy, is important because it is conserved. Only a few physical
quantities are conserved in nature, and studying them yields fundamental insight
into how nature works, as we shall see in our study of momentum.

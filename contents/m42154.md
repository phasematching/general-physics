<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
* Describe the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.
* Explain why the inevitable conversion of energy to less useful forms makes it necessary to conserve energy resources.

</div>

Energy is an important ingredient in all phases of society. We live in a very
interdependent world, and access to adequate and reliable energy resources is
crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives. But
current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. About
40% of the world’s energy comes from oil, and much of that goes to
transportation uses. Oil prices are dependent as much upon new (or foreseen)
discoveries as they are upon political events and situations around the world.
The U.S., with 4.5% of the world’s population, consumes 24% of the world’s oil
production per year; 66% of that oil is imported!

### Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources

The principal energy resources used in the world are shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2184457). The fuel mix has changed over the years
but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are
increasing. **Renewable forms of energy**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id2093286} are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water,
wind, solar, and biomass. About 85% of our energy comes from nonrenewable 
**fossil fuels**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2811292}—oil, natural gas,
coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use, 
with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes
of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will
not be easy.

![A pie chart of the world&#x2019;s energy consumption by source is shown. Thirty-five point four three percent is petroleum, twenty-eight point one five percent is coal, twenty-three point four six percent is dry natural gas, six point two seven percent is hydro-electricity, five point seven nine percent is nuclear electricity, point eight six percent is geothermal, wind, solar, biomass, and point zero five percent is geothermal, biomass, or solar energy not used for electricity.](../resources/Figure_08_09_01a.jpg "World energy consumption by source, in billions of kilowatt-hours: 2006.

### The World’s Growing Energy Needs

World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing
countries. ( See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2876325).) 
Global demand for energy has tripled in
the past 50 years and might triple again in the next 30 years. While much of
this growth will come from the rapidly booming economies of China and India,
many of the developed countries, especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet
their energy needs by expanding the use of renewable sources. Although presently
only a small percentage, renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind
energy. For example, Germany plans to meet 20% of its electricity and 10% of its
overall energy needs with renewable resources by the year 2020. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2090554).) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid
economic growth of China and India. In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the
world’s second largest consumer of oil. However, over 1/3 of this is imported.
Unlike most Western countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of
China, accounting for 2/3 of its energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the
United States as the largest generator of $$ {\text{CO}}_{2} $$. In India, the
main energy resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil
is imported. About 70% of India’s electricity is generated by highly polluting
coal. Yet there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India has a
rapidly growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program
in the world.

![A bar graph depicting world energy consumption is shown. The year is listed on the horizontal axis and energy consumed is listed on the vertical axis. Energy consumption by the world is shown for different years. Energy consumption rises over time. In the year nineteen hundred and ninety it was three hundred seventy three multiplied by ten to the power eighteen joules, and the projection is that it will become eight hundred twelve multiplied by ten to the power eighteen joules by the year twenty thirty five.](../resources/Figure_08_09_02a.jpg "Past and projected world energy use (source: Based on data from U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011)")

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1764068) displays the 2006 commercial energy mix by
country for some of the prime energy users in the world. While non-renewable
sources dominate, some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity
from renewable resources. For example, about 67% of New Zealand’s electricity
demand is met by hydroelectric. Only 10% of the U.S. electricity is generated by
renewable resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to determine total
contributions of renewable energy in some countries with a large rural
population, so these percentages in this table are left blank.

### Energy and Economic Well-being

The last two columns in this table examine the energy and electricity use per
capita. Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries
higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (gross domestic product) per
capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is
borne out in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2123825). Increased efficiency of energy
use will change this dependency. A global problem is balancing energy resource
development against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction
and use.

![A scatter plot of power consumption per capita versus G D P per capita for various countries. Power consumption in kilowatt per capita is shown along the horizontal axis and G D P per capita is show along the vertical axis.](../resources/Figure_08_09_04a.jpg "Power consumption per capita versus GDP per capita for various countries.

{: #import-auto-id2123825}

### Conserving Energy

As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some
distinctions between two sometimes misunderstood terms in the area of energy
use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of energy” is
a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that
cannot be proven from basic principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device,
and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of
energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this
principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important philosophy of
energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount
of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g.,
turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing
conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task—such as
developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater
miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc.

Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one
might wonder why we need to be concerned about our energy resources, since
energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of most
energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion
to energy forms no longer useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the
potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy
transformation. (This will be discussed in more detail
in [Thermodynamics](/contents/m42231).)

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1911578} The relative use of different fuels to provide
  energy has changed over the years, but fuel use is currently dominated by oil,
  although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing.
* {: #import-auto-id1917503} Although non-renewable sources dominate, some
  countries meet a sizeable percentage of their electricity needs from renewable
  resources.
* {: #import-auto-id2114109} The United States obtains only about 10% of its
  energy from renewable sources, mostly hydroelectric power.
* {: #import-auto-id2007732} Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use,
  and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (Gross
  Domestic Product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy
  consumption per capita.
* {: #import-auto-id2076992} Even though, in accordance with the law of
  conservation of energy, energy can never be created or destroyed, energy that
  can be used to do work is always partly converted to less useful forms, such
  as waste heat to the environment, in all of our uses of energy for practical
  purposes.

* Establish the expression for centripetal acceleration.
* Explain the centrifuge.

</div>

We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in its
magnitude or in its direction, or both. In uniform circular motion, the
direction of the velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated
acceleration, even though the magnitude of the velocity might be constant. You
experience this acceleration yourself when you turn a corner in your car. (If
you hold the wheel steady during a turn and move at constant speed, you are in
uniform circular motion.) What you notice is a sideways acceleration because you
and the car are changing direction. The sharper the curve and the greater your
speed, the more noticeable this acceleration will become. In this section we
examine the direction and magnitude of that acceleration.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1561888) shows an object moving in a circular path at
constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous velocity is shown at two
points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in
velocity, which points directly toward the center of rotation (the center of the
circular path). This pointing is shown with the vector diagram in the figure. We
call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion (
resulting from a net external force) the **centripetal acceleration**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id3108952}
( $$ a_{\text{c}} $$); centripetal means “toward the center” or “center seeking.”

![The given figure shows a circle, with a triangle having vertices A B C made from the center to the boundary. A is at the center and B and C points are at the circle path. Lines A B and A C act as radii and B C is a chord. Delta theta is shown inside the triangle, and the arc length delta s and the chord length delta r are also given. At point B, velocity of object is shown as v one and at point C, velocity of object is shown as v two. Along the circle an equation is shown as delta v equals v sub 2 minus v sub 1.](../resources/Figure_07_02_01a.jpg "The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity &#x394;v size 12{&#x394;v} {} is seen to point directly toward the center of curvature. (See small inset.) Because ac=&#x394;v/&#x394;t {a rSub { {c} } =&#x394;v/&#x394;t} {}, the acceleration is also toward the center; ac size 12{a rSub { size 8{c} } } {} is called centripetal acceleration. (Because &#x394;&#x3B8; size 12{&#x394;&#x3B8;} {} is very small, the arc length &#x394;s size 12{&#x394;s} {} is equal to the chord length &#x394;r size 12{&#x394;r} {} for small time differences.)")
{: #import-auto-id1561888}

The direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of curvature, but
what is its magnitude? Note that the triangle formed by the velocity vectors and
the one formed by the radii $$ r $$ and $$ \Delta s $$ are similar. Both the
triangles ABC and PQR are isosceles triangles (two equal sides). The two equal
sides of the velocity vector triangle are the speeds $$ v_{1}= v_{2}=v $$. Using
the properties of two similar triangles, we obtain

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-829">
 $$ \frac{\Delta v}{v}=\frac{\Delta s}{r}\text{.} $$ 
</div>

Acceleration is $$ \Delta v/\Delta t $$, and so we first solve this expression
for $$ \Delta v $$ \:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-0">
 $$ \Delta v=\frac{v}{r}\Delta s\text{.} $$ 
</div>

Then we divide this by $$ \Delta t $$, yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-593">
 $$ \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v}{r}×\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}\text{.} $$ 
</div>

Finally, noting that $$ \Delta v/\Delta t=a_{\text{c}} $$ and that $$ \Delta
s/\Delta t=v $$, the linear or tangential speed, we see that the magnitude of
the centripetal acceleration is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-684">
 $$ a_{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\text{,} $$ 
</div>

which is the acceleration of an object in a circle of radius $$ r $$ at a speed
$$ v $$. So, centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp
curves ( smaller radius), as you have noticed when driving a car. But it is a bit
surprising that $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ is proportional to speed squared, implying,
for example, that it is four times as hard to take a curve at 100 km/h than at
50 km/h. A sharp corner has a small radius, so that $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ is
greater for tighter turns, as you have probably noticed.

It is also useful to express $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ in terms of angular velocity.
Substituting $$ v=r \omega $$ into the above expression, we find $$ a_
{\text{c}}={\left(r \omega }\right)}^{2}/r= r \omega^{2} $$. We can express the
magnitude of centripetal acceleration using either of two equations:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-740">
 $$ a_{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r} \text{ and }  a_{\text{c}}=r \omega^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>

Recall that the direction of $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ is toward the center. You may
use whichever expression is more convenient, as illustrated in examples below.

A **centrifuge**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3256561} (
see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3033074)b) is a rotating device used to separate
specimens of different densities. High centripetal acceleration significantly
decreases the time it takes for separation to occur, and makes separation
possible with small samples. Centrifuges are used in a variety of applications
in science and medicine, including the separation of single cell suspensions
such as bacteria, viruses, and blood cells from a liquid medium and the
separation of macromolecules, such as DNA and protein, from a solution.
Centrifuges are often rated in terms of their centripetal acceleration relative
to acceleration due to gravity $$ (g) $$ ; maximum centripetal acceleration of
several hundred thousand $$ g $$ is possible in a vacuum. Human centrifuges,
extremely large centrifuges, have been used to test the tolerance of astronauts
to the effects of accelerations larger than that of Earth’s gravity.

How Does the Centripetal Acceleration of a Car Around a Curve Compare with That Due to Gravity?
</div>
What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of a car following a curve of radius 500 m at a speed of 25.0 m/s (about 90 km/h)? Compare the acceleration with that due to gravity for this fairly gentle curve taken at highway speed. See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3033074)(a).

**Strategy**

Because $$ v $$ and $$ r $$ are given, the first expression in $$ a_
{\text{c}}=\frac{ {v}^{2}}{r} \text{;} a_{\text{c}}=r \omega^{2} $$ is the most
convenient to use.

**Solution**

Entering the given values of $$ v=25.0\text{m/s} $$ and $$ r=500 \text{m} $$
into the first expression for $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-122">
 $$ a_{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}=\frac{\left(25.0\text{m/s} \right)^{2}}{500 \text{m}}=1.25\text{m/s}^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

To compare this with the acceleration due to gravity $$ \left(
g=9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\right) $$, we take the ratio of $$ a_{\text{c}}/g=\left(
1.25\text{m/s}^{2}\right)
/\left(9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\right)
=0.128 $$. Thus, $$ a_{\text{c}}=0.128 g  $$ and is noticeable especially
if you were not wearing a seat belt.

How Big Is the Centripetal Acceleration in an Ultracentrifuge?
</div>
Calculate the centripetal acceleration of a point 7.50 cm from the axis of an **ultracentrifuge**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2449410}
spinning at  $$ 7.5 \times 10^{4} \text{rev/min.} $$ Determine the ratio of this acceleration to that due to gravity.
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3033074)(b).

**Strategy**

The term rev/min stands for revolutions per minute. By converting this to
radians per second, we obtain the angular velocity $$ \omega $$. Because $$ r $$
is given, we can use the second expression in the equation $$ a_
{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r};a_{\text{c}}=r \omega^{2} $$ to calculate the
centripetal acceleration.

**Solution**

To convert $$ 7.50\times 10^{4}\text{rev}/\text{min} $$ to radians per second,
we use the facts that one revolution is $$ 2\pi \text{rad} $$ and one minute is
60.0 s. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-458">
 $$ \omega =7.50\times 10^{4}\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}}×\frac{2\pi \text{rad}}{1 \text{rev}}×\frac{1\text{min}}{60.0 \text{s}}=7854\text{ rad/s.} $$ 
</div>
Now the centripetal acceleration is given by the second expression in  $$ a_{\text{c}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\mathrm{; }a_{\text{c}}=r \omega^{2} $$ as

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-969">
 $$ a_{\text{c}}=r \omega^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
Converting 7.50 cm to meters and substituting known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-576">
 $$ a_{\text{c}}=\left(0.0750 \text{m}\right)\left(7854 \text{rad/s}\right)^{2}=4.63\times 10^{6}\text{m/s}^{2}. $$ 
</div>
Note that the unitless radians are discarded in order to get the correct units for centripetal acceleration. Taking the ratio of  $$ a_{\text{c}} $$ to $$ g $$
yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-736">
 $$ \frac{ a_{\text{c}}}{g}=\frac{4.63\times 10^{6}}{9.80}=4.72\times 10^{5}. $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

This last result means that the centripetal acceleration is 472 000 times as
strong as $$ g $$. It is no wonder that such high $$ \omega $$ centrifuges are
called ultracentrifuges. The extremely large accelerations involved greatly
decrease the time needed to cause the sedimentation of blood cells or other
materials.

</div>

Of course, a net external force is needed to cause any acceleration, just as
Newton proposed in his second law of motion. So a net external force is needed
to cause a centripetal acceleration. In [Centripetal Force](/contents/m42086),
we will consider the forces involved in circular motion.

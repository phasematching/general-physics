In this module we examine how electromagnetic waves are classified into
categories such as radio, infrared, ultraviolet, and so on, so that we can
understand some of their similarities as well as some of their differences. We
will also find that there are many connections with previously discussed topics,
such as wavelength and resonance. A brief overview of the production and
utilization of electromagnetic waves is found in [[Table 1]](#Table1).

Connections: Waves
</div>
There are many types of waves, such as water waves and even earthquakes. Among the many shared attributes of waves are propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength. These are always related by the expression  $${v}_{\text{W}}=f\lambda  $$ .
 This module concentrates on EM waves, but other modules contain examples of all of these characteristics for sound waves and submicroscopic particles.

</div>

As noted before, an electromagnetic wave has a frequency and a wavelength
associated with it and travels at the speed of light, or $$c $$ . The
relationship among these wave characteristics can be described by $${v}_
{\text{W}}=f\lambda $$ , where $${v}_{\text{W}} $$ is the propagation speed of
the wave, $$f $$ is the frequency, and $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength. Here
$${v}_{\text{W}}=c $$ , so that for all electromagnetic waves,

<div class="equation" >
 $$c=f\lambda . $$
</div>

Thus, for all electromagnetic waves, the greater the frequency, the smaller the
wavelength.

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows how the various types of electromagnetic waves are
categorized according to their wavelengths and frequencies—that is, it shows the
electromagnetic spectrum. Many of the characteristics of the various types of
electromagnetic waves are related to their frequencies and wavelengths, as we
shall see.

![An electromagnetic spectrum is shown. Different wave category regions are indicated using double sided arrows based on the values of their wavelength, energy, and frequency; the visual strip is also shown. The radio wave region is further segmented into AM radio, FM radio, and microwaves bands.](../resources/Figure_24_03_01a.jpg "The electromagnetic spectrum, showing the major categories of electromagnetic waves. The range of frequencies and wavelengths is remarkable. The dividing line between some categories is distinct, whereas other categories overlap.")

<div class="title">
Electromagnetic Spectrum: Rules of Thumb
</div>
Three rules that apply to electromagnetic waves in general are as follows:

* High-frequency electromagnetic waves are more energetic and are more able to
  penetrate than low-frequency waves.
* High-frequency electromagnetic waves can carry more information per unit time
  than low-frequency waves.
* The shorter the wavelength of any electromagnetic wave probing a material, the
  smaller the detail it is possible to resolve.

Note that there are exceptions to these rules of thumb.

</div>

### Transmission, Reflection, and Absorption

What happens when an electromagnetic wave impinges on a material? If the
material is transparent to the particular frequency, then the wave can largely
be transmitted. If the material is opaque to the frequency, then the wave can be
totally reflected. The wave can also be absorbed by the material, indicating
that there is some interaction between the wave and the material, such as the
thermal agitation of molecules.

Of course it is possible to have partial transmission, reflection, and
absorption. We normally associate these properties with visible light, but they
do apply to all electromagnetic waves. What is not obvious is that something
that is transparent to light may be opaque at other frequencies. For example,
ordinary glass is transparent to visible light but largely opaque to ultraviolet
radiation. Human skin is opaque to visible light—we cannot see through
people—but transparent to X-rays.

### Radio and TV Waves

The broad category of **radio waves** is defined to contain any electromagnetic
wave produced by currents in wires and circuits. Its name derives from their
most common use as a carrier of audio information (i.e., radio). The name is
applied to electromagnetic waves of similar frequencies regardless of source.
Radio waves from outer space, for example, do not come from alien radio
stations. They are created by many astronomical phenomena, and their study has
revealed much about nature on the largest scales.

There are many uses for radio waves, and so the category is divided into many
subcategories, including microwaves and those electromagnetic waves used for AM
and FM radio, cellular telephones, and TV.

The lowest commonly encountered radio frequencies are produced by high-voltage
AC power transmission lines at frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz. (
See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) These extremely long wavelength electromagnetic
waves (about 6000 km!) are one means of energy loss in long-distance power
transmission.

![A high-voltage traction power line is shown to the side of a roadway. The power line in the photo has two transmission poles supporting the cables.](../resources/Figure_24_03_03a.jpg "This high-voltage traction power line running to Eutingen Railway Substation in Germany radiates electromagnetic waves with very long wavelengths. (credit: Zonk43, Wikimedia Commons)")
{: #Figure2}

There is an ongoing controversy regarding potential health hazards associated
with exposure to these electromagnetic fields ( $$E $$ -fields). Some people
suspect that living near such transmission lines may cause a variety of
illnesses, including cancer. But demographic data are either inconclusive or
simply do not support the hazard theory. Recent reports that have looked at many
European and American epidemiological studies have found no increase in risk for
cancer due to exposure to $$E $$ -fields.

**Extremely low frequency (ELF)** radio waves of about 1 kHz are used to
communicate with submerged submarines. The ability of radio waves to penetrate
salt water is related to their wavelength (much like ultrasound penetrating
tissue)—the longer the wavelength, the farther they penetrate. Since salt water
is a good conductor, radio waves are strongly absorbed by it, and very long
wavelengths are needed to reach a submarine under the surface. (
See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![The picture of a submarine under water is shown. The submarine is shown to receive extremely low frequency signals shown as a curvy line from the ocean surface to the submarine in the ocean depth.](../resources/Figure_24_03_04a.jpg "Very long wavelength radio waves are needed to reach this submarine, requiring extremely low frequency signals (ELF). Shorter wavelengths do not penetrate to any significant depth.")
{: #Figure3}

AM radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range
from 540 to 1600 kHz. The abbreviation AM stands for **amplitude modulation**,
which is the method for placing information on these waves. (
See [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).) A **carrier wave** having the basic frequency of
the radio station, say 1530 kHz, is varied or modulated in amplitude by an audio
signal. The resulting wave has a constant frequency, but a varying amplitude.

A radio receiver tuned to have the same resonant frequency as the carrier wave
can pick up the signal, while rejecting the many other frequencies impinging on
its antenna. The receiver’s circuitry is designed to respond to variations in
amplitude of the carrier wave to replicate the original audio signal. That audio
signal is amplified to drive a speaker or perhaps to be recorded.

![Part a of the diagram shows a carrier wave along the horizontal axis. The wave is shown to have a high frequency as the vibrations are closely spaced. The wave has constant amplitude represented by uniform height of crest and trough. Part b of the diagram shows an audio wave with a lower frequency. The wave is on the upper side of horizontal axis. The amplitude of the wave is not uniform. It has an initial small rise and fall followed by a steep rise and a gradual fall in the wave. Part c of the diagram shows the amplitude modulated wave. It is the resultant wave obtained by mixing of the waves in part a and part b. The amplitude of the resultant wave is non uniform, similar to the audio wave. The frequency of the amplitude modulated wave is equal to the frequency of the carrier wave. The wave spreads on both sides of the horizontal axis.](../resources/Figure_24_03_05a.jpg "Amplitude modulation for AM radio. (a) A carrier wave at the station&#x2019;s basic frequency. (b) An audio signal at much lower audible frequencies. (c) The amplitude of the carrier is modulated by the audio signal without changing its basic frequency.")
{: #Figure4}

### FM Radio Waves

FM radio waves are also used for commercial radio transmission, but in the
frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz. FM stands for **frequency modulation**,
another method of carrying information. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) Here a
carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station, perhaps 105.1 MHz,
is modulated in frequency by the audio signal, producing a wave of constant
amplitude but varying frequency.

![Part a of the diagram shows a carrier wave along the horizontal axis. The wave is shown to have a high frequency as the vibrations are closely spaced. The wave has constant amplitude represented by uniform height of crest and trough. Part b of the diagram shows an audio wave with a lower frequency as shown by widely spaced vibrations. The wave has constant amplitude, represented by uniform length of crest and trough. Part c shows the frequency modulated wave obtained from waves in part a and part b. The amplitude of the resultant wave is similar to the source waves but the frequency varies. Frequency maxima are shown as closely spaced vibrations and frequency minima are shown as widely spaced vibrations. These maxima and minima are shown to alternate.](../resources/Figure_24_03_06a.jpg "Frequency modulation for FM radio. (a) A carrier wave at the station&#x2019;s basic frequency. (b) An audio signal at much lower audible frequencies. (c) The frequency of the carrier is modulated by the audio signal without changing its amplitude.")
{: #Figure5}

Since audible frequencies range up to 20 kHz (or 0.020 MHz) at most, the
frequency of the FM radio wave can vary from the carrier by as much as 0.020
MHz. Thus the carrier frequencies of two different radio stations cannot be
closer than 0.020 MHz. An FM receiver is tuned to resonate at the carrier
frequency and has circuitry that responds to variations in frequency,
reproducing the audio information.

FM radio is inherently less subject to noise from stray radio sources than AM
radio. The reason is that amplitudes of waves add. So an AM receiver would
interpret noise added onto the amplitude of its carrier wave as part of the
information. An FM receiver can be made to reject amplitudes other than that of
the basic carrier wave and only look for variations in frequency. It is thus
easier to reject noise from FM, since noise produces a variation in amplitude.

**Television** is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves. Since the waves must
carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information, each channel requires
a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission. TV channels
utilize frequencies in the range of 54 to 88 MHz and 174 to 222 MHz. (The entire
FM radio band lies between channels 88 MHz and 174 MHz.) These TV channels are
called VHF (for **very high frequency**). Other channels called UHF (for **ultra
high frequency**) utilize an even higher frequency range of 470 to 1000 MHz.

The TV video signal is AM, while the TV audio is FM. Note that these frequencies
are those of free transmission with the user utilizing an old-fashioned roof
antenna. Satellite dishes and cable transmission of TV occurs at significantly
higher frequencies and is rapidly evolving with the use of the high-definition
or HD format.

Calculating Wavelengths of Radio Waves
</div>
Calculate the wavelengths of a 1530-kHz AM radio signal, a 105.1-MHz FM radio signal, and a 1.90-GHz cell phone signal.

**Strategy**

The relationship between wavelength and frequency is $$c=f\lambda $$ , where
$$c= 3.00 \times 10^{8} \text{m}/\text{s} $$ is the speed of light (the speed of
light is only very slightly smaller in air than it is in a vacuum). We can
rearrange this equation to find the wavelength for all three frequencies.

**Solution**

Rearranging gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\lambda =\frac{c}{f}. $$
</div>
(a) For the  $$f=1530 \text{kHz} $$
 AM radio signal, then,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\lambda & =& \frac{ 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}{1530 \times 10^{3}  \text{cycles/s}}\\ & =& 196 \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
(b) For the  $$f=105.1 \text{MHz} $$
 FM radio signal,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\lambda & =& \frac{ 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}{ 105.1 \times 10^{6}  \text{cycles/s}}\\ & =& 2.85 \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
(c) And for the  $$f=1.90 \text{GHz} $$
 cell phone,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\lambda & =& \frac{ 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}{ 1.90 \times 10^{9}  \text{cycles/s}}\\ & =& 0.158 \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

These wavelengths are consistent with the spectrum in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).
The wavelengths are also related to other properties of these electromagnetic
waves, as we shall see.

</div>

The wavelengths found in the preceding example are representative of AM, FM, and
cell phones, and account for some of the differences in how they are broadcast
and how well they travel. The most efficient length for a linear antenna, such
as discussed in [Production of Electromagnetic Waves](../contents/ch24ProductionOfElectromagneticWaves), is $$\lambda /2
$$ , half the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Thus a very large antenna
is needed to efficiently broadcast typical AM radio with its carrier wavelengths
on the order of hundreds of meters.

One benefit to these long AM wavelengths is that they can go over and around
rather large obstacles (like buildings and hills), just as ocean waves can go
around large rocks. FM and TV are best received when there is a line of sight
between the broadcast antenna and receiver, and they are often sent from very
tall structures. FM, TV, and mobile phone antennas themselves are much smaller
than those used for AM, but they are elevated to achieve an unobstructed line of
sight. (See [[Figure 6]](#Figure6).)

![The first photograph shows a large tower used to broadcast TV signals. The tower is alternately painted red and white along the length. The antennas are shown as small structures on top of the tower. The second photograph shows a photo of a mobile phone tower.

### Radio Wave Interference

Astronomers and astrophysicists collect signals from outer space using
electromagnetic waves. A common problem for astrophysicists is the “pollution”
from electromagnetic radiation pervading our surroundings from communication
systems in general. Even everyday gadgets like our car keys having the facility
to lock car doors remotely and being able to turn TVs on and off using remotes
involve radio-wave frequencies. In order to prevent interference between all
these electromagnetic signals, strict regulations are drawn up for different
organizations to utilize different radio frequency bands.

One reason why we are sometimes asked to switch off our mobile phones (operating
in the range of 1.9 GHz) on airplanes and in hospitals is that important
communications or medical equipment often uses similar radio frequencies and
their operation can be affected by frequencies used in the communication
devices.

For example, radio waves used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have
frequencies on the order of 100 MHz, although this varies significantly
depending on the strength of the magnetic field used and the nuclear type being
scanned. MRI is an important medical imaging and research tool, producing highly
detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed,
and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of
nuclei (usually protons or hydrogen nuclei).

The wavelength of 100-MHz radio waves is 3 m, yet using the sensitivity of the
resonant frequency to the magnetic field strength, details smaller than a
millimeter can be imaged. This is a good example of an exception to a rule of
thumb (in this case, the rubric that details much smaller than the probe’s
wavelength cannot be detected). The intensity of the radio waves used in MRI
presents little or no hazard to human health.

### Microwaves

**Microwaves** are the highest-frequency electromagnetic waves that can be
produced by currents in macroscopic circuits and devices. Microwave frequencies
range from about $$10^{9} \text{Hz} $$ to the highest practical $$\text{LC} $$
resonance at nearly $$ 10^{12} \text{Hz} $$ . Since they have high frequencies,
their wavelengths are short compared with those of other radio waves—hence the
name “microwave.”

Microwaves can also be produced by atoms and molecules. They are, for example, a
component of electromagnetic radiation generated by **thermal agitation**. The
thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above
absolute zero causes them to emit and absorb radiation.

Since it is possible to carry more information per unit time on high
frequencies, microwaves are quite suitable for communications. Most
satellite-transmitted information is carried on microwaves, as are land-based
long-distance transmissions. A clear line of sight between transmitter and
receiver is needed because of the short wavelengths involved.

**Radar** is a common application of microwaves that was first developed in
World War II. By detecting and timing microwave echoes, radar systems can
determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft. A Doppler
shift in the radar echo can be used to determine the speed of a car or the
intensity of a rainstorm. Sophisticated radar systems are used to map the Earth
and other planets, with a resolution limited by wavelength. (
See [[Figure 7]](#Figure7).) The shorter the wavelength of any probe, the
smaller the detail it is possible to observe.

![A photograph of the surface of planet Venus is shown. The lava flows on Venus are shown as orange red color of the surface.](../resources/Figure_24_03_08a.jpg "An image of Sif Mons with lava flows on Venus, based on Magellan synthetic aperture radar data combined with radar altimetry to produce a three-dimensional map of the surface. The Venusian atmosphere is opaque to visible light, but not to the microwaves that were used to create this image. (credit: NSSDC, NASA/JPL)")
{: #Figure7}

### Heating with Microwaves

How does the ubiquitous microwave oven produce microwaves electronically, and
why does food absorb them preferentially? Microwaves at a frequency of 2.45 GHz
are produced by accelerating electrons. The microwaves are then used to induce
an alternating electric field in the oven.

Water and some other constituents of food have a slightly negative charge at one
end and a slightly positive charge at one end (called polar molecules). The
range of microwave frequencies is specially selected so that the polar
molecules, in trying to keep orienting themselves with the electric field,
absorb these energies and increase their temperatures—called dielectric heating.

The energy thereby absorbed results in thermal agitation heating food and not
the plate, which does not contain water. Hot spots in the food are related to
constructive and destructive interference patterns. Rotating antennas and food
turntables help spread out the hot spots.

Another use of microwaves for heating is within the human body. Microwaves will
penetrate more than shorter wavelengths into tissue and so can accomplish “deep
heating” (called microwave diathermy). This is used for treating muscular pains,
spasms, tendonitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

<div class="title">
Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Microwave Ovens
</div>
1.   Look at the door of a microwave oven. Describe the structure of the door. Why is there a metal grid on the door? How does the size of the holes in the grid compare with the wavelengths of microwaves used in microwave ovens? What is this wavelength?
2.   Place a glass of water (about 250 ml) in the microwave and heat it for 30 seconds. Measure the temperature gain (the     $$\Delta \text{T} $$ )    . Assuming that the power output of the oven is 1000 W, calculate the efficiency of the heat-transfer process.
3.   Remove the rotating turntable or moving plate and place a cup of water in several places along a line parallel with the opening. Heat for 30 seconds and measure the
     $$\Delta \text{T} $$     
    for each position. Do you see cases of destructive interference? 

</div>

Microwaves generated by atoms and molecules far away in time and space can be
received and detected by electronic circuits. Deep space acts like a blackbody
with a 2.7 K temperature, radiating most of its energy in the microwave
frequency range. In 1964, Penzias and Wilson detected this radiation and
eventually recognized that it was the radiation of the Big Bang’s cooled
remnants.

### Infrared Radiation

The microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum overlap (
see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). **Infrared radiation** is generally produced by
thermal motion and the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules. Electronic
transitions in atoms and molecules can also produce infrared radiation.

The range of infrared frequencies extends up to the lower limit of visible
light, just below red. In fact, infrared means “below red.” Frequencies at its
upper limit are too high to be produced by accelerating electrons in circuits,
but small systems, such as atoms and molecules, can vibrate fast enough to
produce these waves.

Water molecules rotate and vibrate particularly well at infrared frequencies,
emitting and absorbing them so efficiently that the emissivity for skin is $$e=
0.97 $$ in the infrared. Night-vision scopes can detect the infrared emitted by
various warm objects, including humans, and convert it to visible light.

We can examine radiant heat transfer from a house by using a camera capable of
detecting infrared radiation. Reconnaissance satellites can detect buildings,
vehicles, and even individual humans by their infrared emissions, whose power
radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. More
mundanely, we use infrared lamps, some of which are called quartz heaters, to
preferentially warm us because we absorb infrared better than our surroundings.

The Sun radiates like a nearly perfect blackbody (that is, it has $$e=1 $$ ),
with a 6000 K surface temperature. About half of the solar energy arriving at
the Earth is in the infrared region, with most of the rest in the visible part
of the spectrum, and a relatively small amount in the ultraviolet. On average,
50 percent of the incident solar energy is absorbed by the Earth.

The relatively constant temperature of the Earth is a result of the energy
balance between the incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the
Earth. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by
$${\text{CO}}_{2} $$ and $${\text{H}}_{2}\text{O} $$ in the atmosphere and then
radiated back to Earth or into outer space. This radiation back to Earth is
known as the greenhouse effect, and it maintains the surface temperature of the
Earth about $$40 \text{ºC} $$ higher than it would be if there is no absorption.
Some scientists think that the increased concentration of $${\text{CO}}_{2} $$
and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting from increases in fossil
fuel burning, has increased global average temperatures.

### Visible Light

**Visible light** is the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which
the normal human eye responds. Visible light is produced by vibrations and
rotations of atoms and molecules, as well as by electronic transitions within
atoms and molecules. The receivers or detectors of light largely utilize
electronic transitions. We say the atoms and molecules are excited when they
absorb and relax when they emit through electronic transitions.

[[Figure 8]](#Figure8) shows this part of the spectrum, together with the colors
associated with particular pure wavelengths. We usually refer to visible light
as having wavelengths of between 400 nm and 750 nm. (The retina of the eye
actually responds to the lowest ultraviolet frequencies, but these do not
normally reach the retina because they are absorbed by the cornea and lens of
the eye.)

Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, while violet has
the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths. Blackbody radiation from the
Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but is more intense in the red
than in the violet, making the Sun yellowish in appearance.

![The visible strip of the electromagnetic spectrum is highlighted and shown in the picture. The wave length range is from eight hundred nanometers on the left to three hundred nanometers on the right. The divisions between infrared, visible, and ultraviolet are not perfectly distinct. The colors in the visible strip are also not perfectly distinct; they are marked as bands labeled from red on the left to violet on the right.](../resources/Figure_24_03_10a.jpg "A small part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes its visible components. The divisions between infrared, visible, and ultraviolet are not perfectly distinct, nor are those between the seven rainbow colors.")
{: #Figure8}

Living things—plants and animals—have evolved to utilize and respond to parts of
the electromagnetic spectrum they are embedded in. Visible light is the most
predominant and we enjoy the beauty of nature through visible light. Plants are
more selective. Photosynthesis makes use of parts of the visible spectrum to
make sugars.

Integrated Concept Problem: Correcting Vision with Lasers
</div>
During laser vision correction, a brief burst of 193-nm ultraviolet light is projected onto the cornea of a patient. It makes a spot 0.80 mm in diameter and evaporates a layer of cornea  $$ 0.30 \mu \text{m} $$
 thick. Calculate the energy absorbed, assuming the corneal tissue has the same properties as water; it is initially at  $$34 \text{ºC} $$ .
 Assume the evaporated tissue leaves at a temperature of  $$100 \text{ºC} $$.

**Strategy**

The energy from the laser light goes toward raising the temperature of the
tissue and also toward evaporating it. Thus we have two amounts of heat to add
together. Also, we need to find the mass of corneal tissue involved.

**Solution**

To figure out the heat required to raise the temperature of the tissue to $$100
\text{ºC} $$ , we can apply concepts of thermal energy. We know that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Q}=mc\Delta T, $$
</div>
where Q is the heat required to raise the temperature,  $$\Delta T $$
 is the desired change in temperature,  $$m $$
 is the mass of tissue to be heated, and  $$c $$
 is the specific heat of water equal to 4186 J/kg/K.

Without knowing the mass $$m $$ at this point, we have

<div class="equation" >
 $$Q=m\left(4186 \text{J/kg/K}\right)\left(100 \text{ºC}-34 \text{ºC}\right)=m\left(276 276 \text{J/kg}\right)=m\left(276 \text{kJ/kg}\right). $$
</div>
The latent heat of vaporization of water is 2256 kJ/kg, so that the energy needed to evaporate mass  $$m $$
 is

<div class="equation" >
 $${Q}_{\text{v}}=mL_{\text{v}}=m\left(2256 \text{kJ/kg}\right). $$
</div>
To find the mass  $$m $$ ,
 we use the equation  $$\rho =m/\text{V} $$ ,
 where  $$\rho  $$
 is the density of the tissue and  $$\text{V} $$  is its volume. For this case,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}m& =& \rho \text{V}\\ 
& =& \left( 1000 {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right) \left( \text{area}×\text{thickness}{\text{m}}^{3} \right) \\ 
& =& \left( 1000 \text{kg}{\text{/m}}^{3} \right) \left(\pi \left(0.80 \times 10^{-3} \text{m} \right)^{2}/4\right) \left( 0.30 \times 10^{-6} \text{m}\right) \\ 
& =& 0.151 \times 10^{-9} \text{kg} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
Therefore, the total energy absorbed by the tissue in the eye is the sum of  $$\text{Q} $$
 and  $${\text{Q}}_{\text{v}} $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{Q}}_{\text{tot}}=m\left(c\Delta \text{T}+{\text{L}}_{\text{v}}\right)=\left( 0.151 \times 10^{-9}  \text{kg}\right)\left(276 \text{kJ/kg}+2256 \text{kJ/kg}\right)=382 \times 10^{-9}  \text{kJ}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The lasers used for this eye surgery are excimer lasers, whose light is well
absorbed by biological tissue. They evaporate rather than burn the tissue, and
can be used for precision work. Most lasers used for this type of eye surgery
have an average power rating of about one watt. For our example, if we assume
that each laser burst from this pulsed laser lasts for 10 ns, and there are 400
bursts per second, then the average power is $${\text{Q}}_{\text{tot}}×400=150
\text{mW} $$.

</div>

Optics is the study of the behavior of visible light and other forms of
electromagnetic waves. Optics falls into two distinct categories. When
electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light, interacts with objects that
are large compared with its wavelength, its motion can be represented by
straight lines like rays. Ray optics is the study of such situations and
includes lenses and mirrors.

When electromagnetic radiation interacts with objects about the same size as the
wavelength or smaller, its wave nature becomes apparent. For example, observable
detail is limited by the wavelength, and so visible light can never detect
individual atoms, because they are so much smaller than its wavelength. Physical
or wave optics is the study of such situations and includes all wave
characteristics.

### Ultraviolet Radiation

Ultraviolet means “above violet.” The electromagnetic frequencies of **ultraviolet radiation (UV)** extend upward from violet, the highest-frequency
visible light. Ultraviolet is also produced by atomic and molecular motions and
electronic transitions. The wavelengths of ultraviolet extend from 400 nm down
to about 10 nm at its highest frequencies, which overlap with the lowest X-ray
frequencies. It was recognized as early as 1801 by Johann Ritter that the solar
spectrum had an invisible component beyond the violet range.

Solar UV radiation is broadly subdivided into three regions: UV-A (320-400 nm),
UV-B (290–320 nm), and UV-C (220–290 nm), ranked from long to shorter
wavelengths (from smaller to larger energies). Most UV-B and all UV-C is
absorbed by ozone ( $${\text{O}}_{3} $$ )
molecules in the upper atmosphere. Consequently, 99% of the solar UV radiation
reaching the Earth’s surface is UV-A.

One of the first illustrations of UV light’s impact on Earth occurred during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. The mission included the first astronomical images taken from the moon, using a compact and resilient Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph designed for moon use by scientist and inventor George Robert Carruthers. Designed to capture UV images without the obscuring effects of the Earth’s atmosphere, its most famous image was of the planet itself. Carruthers, who also trained the astronauts on the device’s use, mentioned afterward that “the most immediately obvious and spectacular results were really for the Earth observations, because this was the first time that the Earth had been photographed from a distance in ultraviolet (UV) light, so that you could see the full extent of the hydrogen atmosphere, the polar auroris and what we call the tropical airglow belt.”


### Human Exposure to UV Radiation

It is largely exposure to UV-B that causes skin cancer. It is estimated that as
many as 20% of adults will develop skin cancer over the course of their
lifetime. Again, treatment is often successful if caught early. Despite very
little UV-B reaching the Earth’s surface, there are substantial increases in
skin-cancer rates in countries such as Australia, indicating how important it is
that UV-B and UV-C continue to be absorbed by the upper atmosphere.

All UV radiation can damage collagen fibers, resulting in an acceleration of the
aging process of skin and the formation of wrinkles. Because there is so little
UV-B and UV-C reaching the Earth’s surface, sunburn is caused by large
exposures, and skin cancer from repeated exposure. Some studies indicate a link
between overexposure to the Sun when young and melanoma later in life.

The tanning response is a defense mechanism in which the body produces pigments
to absorb future exposures in inert skin layers above living cells. Basically
UV-B radiation excites DNA molecules, distorting the DNA helix, leading to
mutations and the possible formation of cancerous cells.

Repeated exposure to UV-B may also lead to the formation of cataracts in the
eyes—a cause of blindness among people living in the equatorial belt where
medical treatment is limited. Cataracts, clouding in the eye’s lens and a loss
of vision, are age related; 60% of those between the ages of 65 and 74 will
develop cataracts. However, treatment is easy and successful, as one replaces
the lens of the eye with a plastic lens. Prevention is important. Eye protection
from UV is more effective with plastic sunglasses than those made of glass.

A major acute effect of extreme UV exposure is the suppression of the immune
system, both locally and throughout the body.

Low-intensity ultraviolet is used to sterilize haircutting implements, implying
that the energy associated with ultraviolet is deposited in a manner different
from lower-frequency electromagnetic waves. (Actually this is true for all
electromagnetic waves with frequencies greater than visible light.)

Flash photography is generally not allowed of precious artworks and colored
prints because the UV radiation from the flash can cause photo-degradation in
the artworks. Often artworks will have an extra-thick layer of glass in front of
them, which is especially designed to absorb UV radiation.

### UV Light and the Ozone Layer

If all of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation reached the Earth’s surface, there
would be extremely grave effects on the biosphere from the severe cell damage it
causes. However, the layer of ozone ( $${\text{O}}_{3} $$ )
in our upper atmosphere (10 to 50 km above the Earth) protects life by absorbing
most of the dangerous UV radiation.

Unfortunately, today we are observing a depletion in ozone concentrations in the
upper atmosphere. This depletion has led to the formation of an “ozone hole” in
the upper atmosphere. The hole is more centered over the southern hemisphere,
and changes with the seasons, being largest in the spring. This depletion is
attributed to the breakdown of ozone molecules by refrigerant gases called
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

The UV radiation helps dissociate the CFC’s, releasing highly reactive
chlorine (Cl) atoms, which catalyze the destruction of the ozone layer. For
example, the reaction of $${\text{CFCl}}_{3} $$ with a photon of light $$\left(
\text{hv}\right) $$ can be written as:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{CFCl}}_{3}+\text{h}v \to {\text{CFCl}}_{2}+\text{Cl} \text{.}  $$
</div>

The Cl atom then catalyzes the breakdown of ozone as follows:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{Cl}+{\text{O}}_{3} \to \text{ClO}+{\text{O}}_{2} \text{and ClO}+{\text{O}}_{3} \to \text{Cl}+{2 \text{O}}_{2}. $$
</div>

A single chlorine atom could destroy ozone molecules for up to two years before
being transported down to the surface. The CFCs are relatively stable and will
contribute to ozone depletion for years to come. CFCs are found in refrigerants,
air conditioning systems, foams, and aerosols.

International concern over this problem led to the establishment of the “Montreal Protocol” agreement (1987) to phase out CFC production in most countries. However, developing-country participation is needed if worldwide production and elimination of CFCs is to be achieved. Probably the largest contributor to CFC emissions today is China. And while there are indicators that the Protocol has been a success, there is still substantial risk and variability in the ozone layer. The 2019 Antarctic ozone hole was small and short-lived, continuing the general trend toward recovery. But the 2020 Antarctic ozone hole was the largest and longest-lasting on record, partially due to atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, emissions are not the only concern. Susan Solomon and her colleagues at MIT have uncovered the substantial impact of CFC “banks,” in certain regions, where outdated and deteriorating equipment (such as air conditioners) or materials can release enough CFCs to be detectable in the atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer.  But the protocol seems to be
working, as there are signs of an ozone recovery. (See [[Figure 9]](#Figure9).)

![The map shows the variation in concentration of ozone over Antarctica. The scale for the total ozone level is depicted below the graph in Dobson units. The values are marked in colors of spectrum with the lowest value is marked in violet and the maximum value in red. The Antarctica region is marked in violet showing lesser ozone concentration and more ultraviolet rays. The region around Antarctica is in green, showing slightly higher concentration of ozone.](../resources/Figure_24_03_12a.jpg "This map of ozone concentration over Antarctica in October 2011 shows severe depletion suspected to be caused by CFCs. Less dramatic but more general depletion has been observed over northern latitudes, suggesting the effect is global. With less ozone, more ultraviolet radiation from the Sun reaches the surface, causing more damage. (credit: NASA Ozone Watch)")
{: #Figure9}

### Benefits of UV Light

Besides the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation, there are also benefits of
exposure in nature and uses in technology. Vitamin D production in the skin (
epidermis) results from exposure to UVB radiation, generally from sunlight. A
number of studies indicate lack of vitamin D can result in the development of a
range of cancers (prostate, breast, colon), so a certain amount of UV exposure
is helpful. Lack of vitamin D is also linked to osteoporosis. Exposures (with no
sunscreen) of 10 minutes a day to arms, face, and legs might be sufficient to
provide the accepted dietary level. However, in the winter time north of about
$$37 ^\circ $$ latitude, most UVB gets blocked by the atmosphere.

UV radiation is used in the treatment of infantile jaundice and in some skin
conditions. It is also used in sterilizing workspaces and tools, and killing
germs in a wide range of applications. It is also used as an analytical tool to
identify substances.

When exposed to ultraviolet, some substances, such as minerals, glow in
characteristic visible wavelengths, a process called fluorescence. So-called
black lights emit ultraviolet to cause posters and clothing to fluoresce in the
visible. Ultraviolet is also used in special microscopes to detect details
smaller than those observable with longer-wavelength visible-light microscopes.

Things Great and Small: A Submicroscopic View of X-Ray Production
</div>
X-rays can be created in a high-voltage discharge. They are emitted in the material struck by electrons in the discharge current. There are two mechanisms by which the electrons create X-rays.

The first method is illustrated in [[Figure 10]](#Figure10). An electron is
accelerated in an evacuated tube by a high positive voltage. The electron
strikes a metal plate (e.g., copper) and produces X-rays. Since this is a
high-voltage discharge, the electron gains sufficient energy to ionize the atom.

![An atom is shown. The nucleus is in the center as a cluster of small spheres packed together. Four electron orbits are shown around the nucleus. The one close to the nucleus is circular. All the other orbits are elliptical in nature and inclined at various angles. An electron, represented as a tiny sphere, is shown to strike the atom. An electron is shown knocked out from the closest orbit. A second image of the same atom illustrates another electron striking innermost orbit; a wavy red arrow representing an X-ray is shooting away from the innermost orbit.](../resources/Figure_24_03_13a.jpg "Artist&#x2019;s conception of an electron ionizing an atom followed by the recapture of an electron and emission of an X-ray. An energetic electron strikes an atom and knocks an electron out of one of the orbits closest to the nucleus. Later, the atom captures another electron, and the energy released by its fall into a low orbit generates a high-energy EM wave called an X-ray.")
{: #Figure10}

In the case shown, an inner-shell electron (one in an orbit relatively close to
and tightly bound to the nucleus) is ejected. A short time later, another
electron is captured and falls into the orbit in a single great plunge. The
energy released by this fall is given to an EM wave known as an X-ray. Since the
orbits of the atom are unique to the type of atom, the energy of the X-ray is
characteristic of the atom, hence the name characteristic X-ray.

The second method by which an energetic electron creates an X-ray when it
strikes a material is illustrated in [[Figure 11]](#Figure11). The electron
interacts with charges in the material as it penetrates. These collisions
transfer kinetic energy from the electron to the electrons and atoms in the
material.

![A picture showing an electron represented as a tiny sphere shown to strike the atoms in the material represented as spheres slightly larger in size than the electron. A ray of X ray is shown to come out from the material shown by a wavy arrow.](../resources/Figure_24_03_14a.jpg "Artist&#x2019;s conception of an electron being slowed by collisions in a material and emitting X-ray radiation. This energetic electron makes numerous collisions with electrons and atoms in a material it penetrates. An accelerated charge radiates EM waves, a second method by which X-rays are created.")
{: #Figure11}

A loss of kinetic energy implies an acceleration, in this case decreasing the
electron’s velocity. Whenever a charge is accelerated, it radiates EM waves.
Given the high energy of the electron, these EM waves can have high energy. We
call them X-rays. Since the process is random, a broad spectrum of X-ray energy
is emitted that is more characteristic of the electron energy than the type of
material the electron encounters. Such EM radiation is called “bremsstrahlung” (
German for “braking radiation”).

</div>

### X-Rays

In the 1850s, scientists (such as Faraday) began experimenting with high-voltage
electrical discharges in tubes filled with rarefied gases. It was later found
that these discharges created an invisible, penetrating form of very high
frequency electromagnetic radiation. This radiation was called an **X-ray**,
because its identity and nature were unknown.

As described in [Things Great and Small](#Note1), there are two
methods by which X-rays are created—both are submicroscopic processes and can be
caused by high-voltage discharges. While the low-frequency end of the X-ray
range overlaps with the ultraviolet, X-rays extend to much higher frequencies (
and energies).

X-rays have adverse effects on living cells similar to those of ultraviolet
radiation, and they have the additional liability of being more penetrating,
affecting more than the surface layers of cells. Cancer and genetic defects can
be induced by exposure to X-rays. Because of their effect on rapidly dividing
cells, X-rays can also be used to treat and even cure cancer.

The widest use of X-rays is for imaging objects that are opaque to visible
light, such as the human body or aircraft parts. In humans, the risk of cell
damage is weighed carefully against the benefit of the diagnostic information
obtained. However, questions have risen in recent years as to accidental
overexposure of some people during CT scans—a mistake at least in part due to
poor monitoring of radiation dose.

The ability of X-rays to penetrate matter depends on density, and so an X-ray
image can reveal very detailed density information. [[Figure 12]](#Figure12)
shows an example of the simplest type of X-ray image, an X-ray shadow on film.
The amount of information in a simple X-ray image is impressive, but more
sophisticated techniques, such as CT scans, can reveal three-dimensional
information with details smaller than a millimeter.

![An X ray image of the chest is shown. It shows the section of the heart with artificial heart valves, a pacemaker, and the wires used to close the sternum.](../resources/Figure_24_03_15a.jpg "This shadow X-ray image shows many interesting features, such as artificial heart valves, a pacemaker, and the wires used to close the sternum. (credit: P. P. Urone)")
{: #Figure12}

The use of X-ray technology in medicine is called radiology—an established and
relatively cheap tool in comparison to more sophisticated technologies.
Consequently, X-rays are widely available and used extensively in medical
diagnostics. During World War I, mobile X-ray units, advocated by Madame Marie
Curie, were used to diagnose soldiers.

Because they can have wavelengths less than 0.01 nm, X-rays can be scattered (a
process called X-ray diffraction) to detect the shape of molecules and the
structure of crystals. X-ray diffraction was crucial to Crick, Watson, and
Wilkins in the determination of the shape of the double-helix DNA molecule.

X-rays are also used as a precise tool for trace-metal analysis in X-ray induced
fluorescence, in which the energy of the X-ray emissions are related to the
specific types of elements and amounts of materials present.

### Gamma Rays

Soon after nuclear radioactivity was first detected in 1896, it was found that
at least three distinct types of radiation were being emitted. The most
penetrating nuclear radiation was called a **gamma ray** ( $$\gamma $$
ray) (again a name given because its identity and character were unknown), and
it was later found to be an extremely high frequency electromagnetic wave.

In fact, $$\gamma $$ rays are any electromagnetic radiation emitted by a
nucleus. This can be from natural nuclear decay or induced nuclear processes in
nuclear reactors and weapons. The lower end of the $$\gamma \text{-ray} $$
frequency range overlaps the upper end of the X-ray range, but $$\gamma $$ rays
can have the highest frequency of any electromagnetic radiation.

Gamma rays have characteristics identical to X-rays of the same frequency—they
differ only in source. At higher frequencies, $$\gamma $$ rays are more
penetrating and more damaging to living tissue. They have many of the same uses
as X-rays, including cancer therapy. Gamma radiation from radioactive materials
is used in nuclear medicine.

[[Figure 13]](#Figure13) shows a medical image based on $$\gamma $$ rays. Food
spoilage can be greatly inhibited by exposing it to large doses of $$\gamma $$
radiation, thereby obliterating responsible microorganisms. Damage to food cells
through irradiation occurs as well, and the long-term hazards of consuming
radiation-preserved food are unknown and controversial for some groups. Both
X-ray and $$\gamma \text{-ray} $$ technologies are also used in scanning luggage
at airports.

![A skeletal image of a human body is shown. The image represents gamma rays emitted by nuclei in a compound that is concentrated in the bones and eliminated through the kidneys. Some parts of the image are darker than the others. The ribs are shown darker than the leg and hand bones.](../resources/Figure_24_03_16a.jpg "This is an image of the \( \gamma \) rays emitted by nuclei in a compound that is concentrated in the bones and eliminated through the kidneys. Bone cancer is evidenced by nonuniform concentration in similar structures. For example, some ribs are darker than others. (credit: P. P. Urone)")
{: #Figure13}

### Detecting Electromagnetic Waves from Space

The entire electromagnetic spectrum is used by researchers for investigating stars, space, and time. Arthur B. C. Walker was a pioneer in X-ray and ultraviolet observations, and designed specialized telescopes and instruments to observe the Sun’s atmosphere and corona. His developments significantly advanced our understanding of stars, and some of his developments are currently in use in space telescopes as well as in microchip manufacturing. As noted earlier, Penzias and Wilson detected microwaves to identify the background radiation originating from the Big Bang. Radio telescopes such as the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico and Parkes Observatory in Australia were designed to detect radio waves.

Infrared telescopes need to have their detectors cooled by liquid nitrogen to be
able to gather useful signals. Since infrared radiation is predominantly from
thermal agitation, if the detectors were not cooled, the vibrations of the
molecules in the antenna would be stronger than the signal being collected.

The most famous of these infrared sensitive telescopes is the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. The earliest telescopes, developed in the
seventeenth century, were optical telescopes, collecting visible light.
Telescopes in the ultraviolet, X-ray, and $$\gamma $$ -ray regions are placed
outside the atmosphere on satellites orbiting the Earth.

The Hubble Space Telescope (launched in 1990) gathers ultraviolet radiation as
well as visible light. In the X-ray region, there is the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (launched in 1999), and in the $$\gamma $$ -ray region, there is the
new Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (launched in 2008—taking the place of the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, 1991–2000.). The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in late 2021, observes in a lower-frequency portion of the spectrum compared to Hubble. The JWST observes in long-wavelength visible light (red) through infrared, enabling it to detect objects that are further away, older, and fainter than previous telescopes could detect.

### Section Summary

* The relationship among the speed of propagation, wavelength, and frequency for
  any wave is given by $${v}_{\text{W}}=f\lambda $$ , so that for
  electromagnetic waves,

  <div class="equation" >
   $$c=f\lambda , $$
  </div>
     where    $$f $$ is the frequency,
   $$\lambda  $$ is the wavelength, and    $$c $$ is the speed of light.
* The electromagnetic spectrum is separated into many categories and
  subcategories, based on the frequency and wavelength, source, and uses of the
  electromagnetic waves.
* Any electromagnetic wave produced by currents in wires is classified as a
  radio wave, the lowest frequency electromagnetic waves. Radio waves are
  divided into many types, depending on their applications, ranging up to
  microwaves at their highest frequencies.
* Infrared radiation lies below visible light in frequency and is produced by
  thermal motion and the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules.
  Infrared’s lower frequencies overlap with the highest-frequency microwaves.
* Visible light is largely produced by electronic transitions in atoms and
  molecules, and is defined as being detectable by the human eye. Its colors
  vary with frequency, from red at the lowest to violet at the highest.
* Ultraviolet radiation starts with frequencies just above violet in the visible
  range and is produced primarily by electronic transitions in atoms and
  molecules.
* X-rays are created in high-voltage discharges and by electron bombardment of
  metal targets. Their lowest frequencies overlap the ultraviolet range but
  extend to much higher values, overlapping at the high end with gamma rays.
* Gamma rays are nuclear in origin and are defined to include the
  highest-frequency electromagnetic radiation of any type.

Conversations with astronauts on lunar walks had an echo that was used to estimate the distance to the Moon. The sound spoken by the person on Earth was transformed into a radio signal sent to the Moon, and transformed back into sound on a speaker inside the astronaut’s space suit. This sound was picked up by the microphone in the space suit (intended for the astronaut’s voice) and sent back to Earth as a radio echo of sorts. If the round-trip time was 2.60 s, what was the approximate distance to the Moon, neglecting any delays in the electronics?

### Glossary
{: class="glossary-title"}

electromagnetic spectrum
: the full range of wavelengths or frequencies of electromagnetic radiation

radio waves
: electromagnetic waves with wavelengths in the range from 1 mm to 100 km; they
are produced by currents in wires and circuits and by astronomical phenomena

microwaves
: electromagnetic waves with wavelengths in the range from 1 mm to 1 m; they can
be produced by currents in macroscopic circuits and devices

thermal agitation
: the thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above
absolute zero, which causes them to emit and absorb radiation

radar
: a common application of microwaves. Radar can determine the distance to
objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft, as well as determine the speed of a
car or the intensity of a rainstorm

infrared radiation (IR)
: a region of the electromagnetic spectrum with a frequency range that extends
from just below the red region of the visible light spectrum up to the microwave
region, or from $$ 0.74 \mu\text{m} $$ to $$300 \mu\text{m} $$

ultraviolet radiation (UV)
: electromagnetic radiation in the range extending upward in frequency from
violet light and overlapping with the lowest X-ray frequencies, with wavelengths
from 400 nm down to about 10 nm

visible light
: the narrow segment of the electromagnetic spectrum to which the normal human
eye responds

amplitude modulation (AM)
: a method for placing information on electromagnetic waves by modulating the
amplitude of a carrier wave with an audio signal, resulting in a wave with
constant frequency but varying amplitude

extremely low frequency (ELF)
: electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths usually in the range of 0 to 300
Hz, but also about 1kHz

carrier wave
: an electromagnetic wave that carries a signal by modulation of its amplitude
or frequency

frequency modulation (FM)
: a method of placing information on electromagnetic waves by modulating the
frequency of a carrier wave with an audio signal, producing a wave of constant
amplitude but varying frequency

TV
: video and audio signals broadcast on electromagnetic waves

very high frequency (VHF)
: TV channels utilizing frequencies in the two ranges of 54 to 88 MHz and 174 to
222 MHz

ultra-high frequency (UHF)
: TV channels in an even higher frequency range than VHF, of 470 to 1000 MHz

X-ray
: invisible, penetrating form of very high frequency electromagnetic radiation,
overlapping both the ultraviolet range and the $$\gamma $$ -ray range

gamma ray
: (
$$\gamma $$ ray); extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted by
the nucleus of an atom, either from natural nuclear decay or induced nuclear
processes in nuclear reactors and weapons. The lower end of the $$\gamma $$ -ray
frequency range overlaps the upper end of the X-ray range, but $$\gamma $$ rays
can have the highest frequency of any electromagnetic radiation

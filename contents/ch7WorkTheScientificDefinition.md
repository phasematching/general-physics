### What It Means to Do Work

The scientific definition of work differs in some ways from its everyday
meaning. Certain things we think of as hard work, such as writing an exam or
carrying a heavy load on level ground, are not work as defined by a scientist.
The scientific definition of work reveals its relationship to energy—whenever
work is done, energy is transferred.

For work, in the scientific sense, to be done, a force must be exerted and there
must be displacement in the direction of the force.

Formally, the **work** done on a system by a constant force is defined to be 
*the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the
distance through which the force acts*. For one-way motion in one dimension,
this is expressed in equation form as

<div class="equation">
 $$ W= \mag{F} \left(\cos \theta \right) \mag{d} , $$
</div>

where $$ W $$ is work, $$ \mag{d} $$ is the magnitude of the displacement of the
system, and $$ \theta $$ is the angle between the force vector $$ \vb{F} $$ and
the displacement vector $$ \vb{d} $$, as in [Figure 1](#Figure1). We can also write
this as

<div class="equation">
 $$ W=Fd\cos{\theta} . $$
</div>

To find the work done on a system that undergoes motion that is not one-way or
that is in two or three dimensions, we divide the motion into one-way
one-dimensional segments and add up the work done over each segment.

What is Work?
</div>
The work done on a system by a constant force is *the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts*. For one-way motion in one dimension, this is expressed in equation form as

<div class="equation">
 $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} , $$
</div>
where $$ W $$ is work,
$$ F $$ is the magnitude of the force on the system,
$$ d $$ is the magnitude of the displacement of the system,
and $$ \theta $$ is the angle between the force vector $$ \vb{F} $$
and the displacement vector $$ \vb{d} $$.

![Five drawings labeled a through e. In (a), person pushing a lawn mower with a force F. Force is represented by a vector making an angle theta with the horizontal and displacement of the mower is represented by vector d. The component of vector F along vector d is F cosine theta. Work done by the person W is equal to F d cosine theta. (b) A person is standing with a briefcase in his hand. The force F shown by a vector arrow pointing upwards starting from the handle of briefcase and the displacement d is equal to zero.
(c) A person is walking holding the briefcase in his hand. Force vector F is in the vertical direction starting from the handle of briefcase and displacement vector d is in horizontal direction starting from the same point as vector F. The angle between F and d theta is equal to 90 degrees. Cosine theta is equal to zero. (d) A briefcase is shown in front of a set of stairs. A vector d starting from the first stair points along the incline of the stair and a force vector F is in vertical direction starting from the same point as vector d. The angle between them is theta. A component of vector F along vector d is F d cosine theta. (e) A briefcase is shown lowered vertically down from an electric generator. The displacement vector d points downwards and force vector F points upwards acting on the briefcase.](../resources/Figure_07_02_01.jpg "Examples of work. (a) The work done by the force \( F \) on this lawn mower is \( F d \cos{ \theta} \) . Note that \( F \cos{ \theta} \) is the component of the force in the direction of motion. (b) A person holding a briefcase does no work on it, because there is no displacement. No energy is transferred to or from the briefcase.
(c) The person moving the briefcase horizontally at a constant speed does no work on it, and transfers no energy to it. (d) Work is done on the briefcase by carrying it up stairs at constant speed, because there is necessarily a component of force \( F \) in the direction of the motion. Energy is transferred to the briefcase and could in turn be used to do work. (e) When the briefcase is lowered, energy is transferred out of the briefcase and into an electric generator. Here the work done on the briefcase by the generator is negative, removing energy from the briefcase, because \( F \) and \( d \) are in opposite directions.")
{: #Figure1}

To examine what the definition of work means, let us consider the other
situations shown in [Figure 1](#Figure1). The person holding the briefcase
in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(b) does no work, for example. Here $$ d=0 $$, so $$ W=0 $$.
Why is it you get tired just holding a load? The answer is that your muscles are
doing work against one another, *but they are doing no work on the system of
interest* (the “briefcase-Earth
system”—see [Gravitational Potential Energy](../contents/ch7GravitationalPotentialEnergy.md)
for more details). There must be displacement for work to be done, and there
must be a component of the force in the direction of the motion. For example,
the person carrying the briefcase on level ground in [Figure 1](#Figure1)
(c) does no work on it, because the force is perpendicular to the motion. That
is, $$\cos{90^\circ} =0 $$, and so $$ W=0 $$.

In contrast, when a force exerted on the system has a component in the direction
of motion, such as in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(d), work *is*
done—energy is transferred to the briefcase. Finally, in [Figure 1](#Figure1)(e),
energy is transferred from the briefcase to a generator. There are two good ways
to interpret this energy transfer. One interpretation is that the briefcase’s
weight does work on the generator, giving it energy. The other interpretation is
that the generator does negative work on the briefcase, thus removing energy
from it. The drawing shows the latter, with the force from the generator upward
on the briefcase, and the displacement downward. This makes $$ \theta =180^\circ
$$, and $$ \cos 180^\circ=-1 $$; therefore, $$ W $$ is negative.

### Calculating Work

Work and energy have the same units. From the definition of work, we see that
those units are force times distance. Thus, in SI units, work and energy are
measured in **newton-meters**. A newton-meter is given the special name 
**joule** (J), and $$ 1 \J =1\N \cdot \m =1\kg \cdot \mmss $$. One joule is not a
large amount of energy; it would lift a small 100-gram apple a distance of about
1 meter.

Calculating the Work You Do to Push a Lawn Mower Across a Large Lawn
</div>
How much work is done on the lawn mower by the person in [Figure 1](#Figure1)
(a) if he exerts a constant force of $$ 75.0\N $$ at an angle $$35^\circ $$
below the horizontal and pushes the mower $$ 25.0\m $$
on level ground? Convert the amount of work from joules to kilocalories and
compare it with this person’s average daily intake of $$
10 000 \text{kJ} $$ (about $$2400 \text{kcal} $$)
of food energy. One *calorie* (1 cal) of heat is the amount required to warm 1
g of water by $$ 1^\circ\text{C} $$, and is equivalent to $$
4.184 \J $$, while one *food calorie* (1 kcal) is equivalent to $$4184 \J $$.

**Strategy**

We can solve this problem by substituting the given values into the definition
of work done on a system, stated in the equation $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} $$. The
force, angle, and displacement are given, so that only the work $$ W $$ is
unknown.

**Solution**

The equation for the work is

<div class="equation">
 $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} . $$
</div>
Substituting the known values gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
W&=& \left(75.0 \N \right)\left(25.0 \m \right)\cos\left(35.0^\circ\right)\\
W&=& 1536 \J =1.54\times 10^{3} \J .
\end{array} $$
</div>
Converting the work in joules to kilocalories yields
$$ W=\left(1536 \J \right)\left(1\text{kcal}/4184 \J \right)=0.367\text{kcal} $$.
The ratio of the work done to the daily consumption is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{W}{2400 \text{kcal}}=1.53\times 10^{-4}. $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This ratio is a tiny fraction of what the person consumes, but it is typical.
Very little of the energy released in the consumption of food is used to do
work. Even when we “work” all day long, less than 10% of our food energy intake
is used to do work and more than 90% is converted to thermal energy or stored as
chemical energy in fat.

### Section Summary

* Work is the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is
  displaced.
* The work $$ W $$ that a force $$ \vb{F} $$ does on an object is the product of
  the magnitude $$ F $$ of the force, times the magnitude $$ d $$ of the
  displacement, times the cosine of the angle $$ \theta $$ between them. In
  symbols,
  <div class="equation">
  $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} . $$
  </div>

* The SI unit for work and energy is the joule (J), where $$ 1 \J =1\N \cdot \m
  =1 \kg \cdot \mmss $$.
* The work done by a force is zero if the displacement is either zero or
  perpendicular to the force.
* The work done is positive if the force and displacement have the same
  direction, and negative if they have opposite direction.

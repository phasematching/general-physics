</div>

Muscles, bones, and joints are some of the most interesting applications of
statics. There are some surprises. Muscles, for example, exert far greater
forces than we might think. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2793101) shows a forearm
holding a book and a schematic diagram of an analogous lever system. The
schematic is a good approximation for the forearm, which looks more complicated
than it is, and we can get some insight into the way typical muscle systems
function by analyzing it.

Muscles can only contract, so they occur in pairs. In the arm, the biceps muscle
is a flexor—that is, it closes the limb. The triceps muscle is an extensor that
opens the limb. This configuration is typical of skeletal muscles, bones, and
joints in humans and other vertebrates. Most skeletal muscles exert much larger
forces within the body than the limbs apply to the outside world. The reason is
clear once we realize that most muscles are attached to bones via tendons close
to joints, causing these systems to have mechanical advantages much less than
one. Viewing them as simple machines, the input force is much greater than the
output force, as seen in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2793101).

![A forearm of a person holding a physics book is shown. The biceps and triceps muscles of the arm are visible. The elbow joint is the pivot point. The upper part of the arm is vertical and the lower part is horizontal. Biceps muscles are applying a force F B upward. The vertical bone of hand exerts a force F E on the pivot. At the midpoint of the lower part of the hand, the center of gravity of the hand is shown where the weight of the hand acts. The midpoint of the front face of the book is its center of gravity, where its weight acts downward. A free body diagram is also shown and the distances of the three forces F-B, C-G of arm, and C-G of book from the pivot are shown as r one, r two and r three.](../resources/Figure_10_06_01a.jpg "(a) The figure shows the forearm of a person holding a book.

Muscles Exert Bigger Forces Than You Might Think
</div>
Calculate the force the biceps muscle must exert to hold the forearm and its load as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2793101), and compare this force with the weight of the forearm plus its load. You may take the data in the figure to be accurate to three significant figures.

**Strategy**

There are four forces acting on the forearm and its load (the system of
interest). The magnitude of the force of the biceps is $$ F_{\text{B}} $$ ; that
of the elbow joint is $$ F_{\text{E}} $$ ; that of the weights of the forearm is
$$ w_{\text{a}} $$, and its load is $$ w_{\text{b}} $$. Two of these are
unknown ( $$ F_{\text{B}} $$ and $$ F_{\text{E}} $$),
so that the first condition for equilibrium cannot by itself yield $$ F_
{\text{B}} $$. But if we use the second condition and choose the pivot to be at
the elbow, then the torque due to $$ F_{\text{E}} $$ is zero, and the only
unknown becomes $$ F_{\text{B}} $$.

**Solution**

The torques created by the weights are clockwise relative to the pivot, while
the torque created by the biceps is counterclockwise; thus, the second condition
for equilibrium $$ \left(\text{net}\tau =0 \right) $$ becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-950">
 $$ r_{2} w_{\text{a}}+ r_{3} w_{\text{b}}= r_{1} F_{\text{B}}. $$ 
</div>
Note that $$ \sin{\theta} =1 $$ for all forces, since $$ \theta =90^\circ $$
for all forces. This equation can easily be solved for $$ F_{\text{B}} $$
in terms of known quantities, yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-574">
 $$ F_{\text{B}}=\frac{ r_{2} w_{\text{a}}+ r_{3} w_{\text{b}}}{ r_{1}}. $$ 
</div>
Entering the known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-311">
 $$ F_{\text{B}}=\frac{ \left(0.160\m \right)\left(2.50\kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)+\left(0.380\m \right)\left(4.00\kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)}{0.0400\m } $$ 
</div>
which yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-232">
 $$ F_{\text{B}}=470 \N . $$ 
</div>
Now, the combined weight of the arm and its load is  
$$ \left(6.50 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)=63.7 \N $$,
so that the ratio of the force exerted by the biceps to the total weight is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-476">
 $$ \frac{ F_{\text{B}}}{ w_{\text{a}}+ w_{\text{b}}}=
\frac{470}{63.7}=7.38. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This means that the biceps muscle is exerting a force 7.38 times the weight
supported.

</div>

In the above example of the biceps muscle, the angle between the forearm and
upper arm is 90°. If this angle changes, the force exerted by the biceps muscle
also changes. In addition, the length of the biceps muscle changes. The force
the biceps muscle can exert depends upon its length; it is smaller when it is
shorter than when it is stretched.

Very large forces are also created in the joints. In the previous example, the
downward force $$ F_{\text{E}} $$ exerted by the humerus at the elbow joint equals 407 N, or 6.38 times
the total weight supported. (The calculation of $$ F_{\text{E}} $$ is
straightforward and is left as an end-of-chapter problem.) Because muscles can
contract, but not expand beyond their resting length, joints and muscles often
exert forces that act in opposite directions and thus subtract. (In the above
example, the upward force of the muscle minus the downward force of the joint
equals the weight supported—that is, $$ 470 \N –407 \N =63 \N 
$$, approximately equal to the weight supported.) Forces in muscles and joints
are largest when their load is a long distance from the joint, as the book is in
the previous example.

In racquet sports such as tennis the constant extension of the arm during game
play creates large forces in this way. The mass times the lever arm of a tennis
racquet is an important factor, and many players use the heaviest racquet they
can handle. It is no wonder that joint deterioration and damage to the tendons
in the elbow, such as “tennis elbow,” can result from repetitive motion, undue
torques, and possibly poor racquet selection in such sports. Various tried
techniques for holding and using a racquet or bat or stick not only increases
sporting prowess but can minimize fatigue and long-term damage to the body. For
example, tennis balls correctly hit at the “sweet spot” on the racquet will
result in little vibration or impact force being felt in the racquet and the
body—less torque as explained
in [Collisions of Extended Bodies in Two Dimensions](/contents/m42183). Twisting
the hand to provide top spin on the ball or using an extended rigid elbow in a
backhand stroke can also aggravate the tendons in the elbow.

Training coaches and physical therapists use the knowledge of relationships
between forces and torques in the treatment of muscles and joints. In physical
therapy, an exercise routine can apply a particular force and torque which can,
over a period of time, revive muscles and joints. Some exercises are designed to
be carried out under water, because this requires greater forces to be exerted,
further strengthening muscles. However, connecting tissues in the limbs, such as
tendons and cartilage as well as joints are sometimes damaged by the large
forces they carry. Often, this is due to accidents, but heavily muscled
athletes, such as weightlifters, can tear muscles and connecting tissue through
effort alone.

The back is considerably more complicated than the arm or leg, with various
muscles and joints between vertebrae, all having mechanical advantages less than

1. Back muscles must, therefore, exert very large forces, which are borne by the
   spinal column. Discs crushed by mere exertion are very common. The jaw is
   somewhat exceptional—the masseter muscles that close the jaw have a
   mechanical advantage greater than 1 for the back teeth, allowing us to exert
   very large forces with them. A cause of stress headaches is persistent
   clenching of teeth where the sustained large force translates into fatigue in
   muscles around the skull.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1430599) shows how bad posture causes back strain. In
part (a), we see a person with good posture. Note that her upper body’s cg is
directly above the pivot point in the hips, which in turn is directly above the
base of support at her feet. Because of this, her upper body’s weight exerts no
torque about the hips. The only force needed is a vertical force at the hips
equal to the weight supported. No muscle action is required, since the bones are
rigid and transmit this force from the floor. This is a position of unstable
equilibrium, but only small forces are needed to bring the upper body back to
vertical if it is slightly displaced. Bad posture is shown in part (b)
; we see that the upper body’s cg is in front of the pivot in the hips. This
creates a clockwise torque around the hips that is counteracted by muscles in
the lower back. These muscles must exert large forces, since they have typically
small mechanical advantages. (In other words, the perpendicular lever arm for
the muscles is much smaller than for the cg.) Poor posture can also cause muscle
strain for people sitting at their desks using computers. Special chairs are
available that allow the body’s CG to be more easily situated above the seat, to
reduce back pain. Prolonged muscle action produces muscle strain. Note that the
cg of the entire body is still directly above the base of support in part (
b) of [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1430599). This is compulsory; otherwise the
person would not be in equilibrium. We lean forward for the same reason when
carrying a load on our backs, to the side when carrying a load in one arm, and
backward when carrying a load in front of us, as seen
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3039508).

![In part a of the figure, a side view of a girl standing on a surface is shown. The weight of the girl is acting vertically downward and is in the line with her hips. A point above her legs is marked as the pivot point. The weight vector is in the direction of the pivot. In part b, a side view of a girl standing on a surface is shown. The girl is bending slightly toward her front. The weight of her upper body is acting downward and the line of action of weight is not passing through the upper body pivot point.](../resources/Figure_10_06_02a.jpg "(a) Good posture places the upper body&#x2019;s cg over the pivots in the hips, eliminating the need for muscle action to balance the body. (b) Poor posture requires exertion by the back muscles to counteract the clockwise torque produced around the pivot by the upper body&#x2019;s weight. The back muscles have a small effective perpendicular lever arm, \( r_b \), and must therefore exert a large force \( F_b \) . Note that the legs lean backward to keep the cg of the entire body above the base of support in the feet.")
{: #import-auto-id1430599}

You have probably been warned against lifting objects with your back. This
action, even more than bad posture, can cause muscle strain and damage discs and
vertebrae, since abnormally large forces are created in the back muscles and
spine.

![In image a, a man with a child on his shoulders is shown in which the child is holding the head of the man. The center of gravity is marked at the center of his body. In image b, a man with a long bag on his left shoulder and leaning toward the right is shown. The center of gravity is marked at the center of his body slightly left of the middle. In image c, a lady walking toward the right is shown. She is holding books in her hands. The center of gravity is marked at the center of her body above her legs.](../resources/Figure_10_06_03a.jpg "People adjust their stance to maintain balance.

<div data-type="title">
Do Not Lift with Your Back
</div>
Consider the person lifting a heavy box with his back, shown in
[\[link\]](#import-auto-id2552526).
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the force $$ F_{\text{B}}– $$ in the back muscles that is needed to support the upper body plus the box and
compare this with his weight. The mass of the upper body is 55.0 kg and the mass
of the box is 30.0 kg.
(b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the force $$ \vb{F}_{\text{V}}– $$
exerted by the vertebrae on the spine at the indicated pivot point. Again, data
in the figure may be taken to be accurate to three significant figures.

**Strategy**

By now, we sense that the second condition for equilibrium is a good place to
start, and inspection of the known values confirms that it can be used to solve
for $$ F_{\text{B}}– $$ if the pivot is chosen to be at the hips. The torques
created by $$ \vb{w}_{\text{ub}} $$ and $$ \vb{w}_
{\text{box}}– $$ are clockwise, while that created by $$ \vb{F}_
{\text{B}}– $$ is counterclockwise.

**Solution for (a)**

Using the perpendicular lever arms given in the figure, the second condition for
equilibrium $$ \left( \text{net}\tau =0 \right) $$ becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-780">
 $$ \left(0.350 \m \right)\left(55.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)+\left(0.500 \m \right)\left(30.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80\mss \right)=\left(0.0800 \m \right) F_{\text{B}}. $$ 
</div>
Solving for $$ F_{\text{B}} $$ yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-826">
 $$ F_{\text{B}}=4.20\times 10^{3}\N . $$ 
</div>
The ratio of the force the back muscles exert to the weight of the upper body plus its load is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-864">
 $$ \frac{ F_{\text{B}}}{ w_{\text{ub}}+ w_{\text{box}}}=\frac{4200 \N }{833 \N }=5.04. $$ 
</div>
This force is considerably larger than it would be if the load were not present.

**Solution for (b)**

More important in terms of its damage potential is the force on the vertebrae 
$$ \vb{F}_{\text{V}} $$. The first condition for equilibrium ( $$ \text{net}\vb{F}=0 $$)
can be used to find its magnitude and direction. Using $$ y $$ for vertical
and $$ x $$ for horizontal, the condition for the net external forces along
those axes to be zero

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-349">
 $$ \text{net} F_{y}=0\text{and}\text{net} F_{x}=0. $$ 
</div>
Starting with the vertical ($$ y $$) components, this yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-486">
 $$ F_{\text{V}y}– w_{\text{ub}}–w_{\text{box}}– F_{\text{B}} \sin{29.0^\circ }=0. $$ 
</div>
Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-325">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll} 
F_{\text{V}y}& =& w_{\text{ub}}+w_{\text{box}}+ F_{\text{B}}
\sin{29.0^\circ }\\
 & =& 833 \N +\left(4200 \N \right)\sin{29.0^\circ }
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-600">
 $$ F_{\text{V}y}=2.87\times 10^{3}\N . $$ 
</div>
Similarly, for the horizontal ( $$ x $$ ) components,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-341">
 $$ F_{\text{V}x}– F_{\text{B}}\cos{29.0^\circ }=0 $$ 
</div>
yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-425">
 $$ F_{\text{V}x}=3.67\times 10^{3}\N . $$ 
</div>
The magnitude of $$ \vb{F}_{\text{V}} $$ 
is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-797">
 $$ F_{\text{V}}=\sqrt{ F_{\text{V}x}^{2}+ F_{\text{V}y}^{2}}=4.66\times 10^{3}\N . $$ 
</div>
The direction of $$ \vb{F}_{\text{V}} $$ is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-29">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{–1}\left(\frac{ F_{\text{V}y}}{ F_{\text{V}x}}\right)=38.0^\circ. $$ 
</div>
Note that the ratio of $$ F_{\text{V}} $$ to the weight supported is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-142">
 $$ \frac{ F_{\text{V}}}{ w_{\text{ub}}+w_{\text{box}}}=\frac{4660 \N }{833 \N }=5.59. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This force is about 5.6 times greater than it would be if the person were
standing erect. The trouble with the back is not so much that the forces are
large—because similar forces are created in our hips, knees, and ankles—but that
our spines are relatively weak. Proper lifting, performed with the back erect
and using the legs to raise the body and load, creates much smaller forces in
the back—in this case, about 5.6 times smaller.

</div>

![A man is bending forward to lift a box. The back muscles and vertebrae of the person are shown. The weight of the box is acting downward at its center of gravity. The vertebrae of the man are inclined vertical at sixty one degrees. A point on the joint of legs to the upper body is the pivot point. The distance between the center of gravity of the box and the pivot is fifty centimeters and perpendicular distance between the pivot and the weight of the man is thirty five centimeters.](../resources/Figure_10_06_04a.jpg "This figure shows that large forces are exerted by the back muscles and experienced in the vertebrae when a person lifts with their back, since these muscles have small effective perpendicular lever arms. The data shown here are analyzed in the preceding example, [link].")
{: #import-auto-id2552526}

What are the benefits of having most skeletal muscles attached so close to
joints? One advantage is speed because small muscle contractions can produce
large movements of limbs in a short period of time. Other advantages are
flexibility and agility, made possible by the large numbers of joints and the
ranges over which they function. For example, it is difficult to imagine a
system with biceps muscles attached at the wrist that would be capable of the
broad range of movement we vertebrates possess.

There are some interesting complexities in real systems of muscles, bones, and
joints. For instance, the pivot point in many joints changes location as the
joint is flexed, so that the perpendicular lever arms and the mechanical
advantage of the system change, too. Thus the force the biceps muscle must exert
to hold up a book varies as the forearm is flexed. Similar mechanisms operate in
the legs, which explain, for example, why there is less leg strain when a
bicycle seat is set at the proper height. The methods employed in this section
give a reasonable description of real systems provided enough is known about the
dimensions of the system. There are many other interesting examples of force and
torque in the body—a few of these are the subject of end-of-chapter problems.

### Section Summary

* Statics plays an important part in understanding everyday strains in our
  muscles and bones.
* Many lever systems in the body have a mechanical advantage of significantly
  less than one, as many of our muscles are attached close to joints.
* Someone with good posture stands or sits in such a way that the person\'s
  center of gravity lies directly above the pivot point in the hips, thereby
  avoiding back strain and damage to disks.

**Integrated Concepts**  

Suppose we replace the 4.0-kg book in [[link]](#fs-id1169737911368) of the
biceps muscle with an elastic exercise rope that obeys Hooke’s Law. Assume its
force constant $$ k=600 \text{N/m} $$.
(a) How much is the rope stretched (past
equilibrium) to provide the same force $$ F_{\text{B}} $$ as in this example?
Assume the rope is held in the hand at the same location as the book.
(b) What force is on the biceps muscle if the exercise rope is pulled straight up so that
the forearm makes an angle of $$ 25^\circ $$ with the horizontal? Assume the
biceps muscle is still perpendicular to the forearm.

You have just planted a sturdy 2-m-tall palm tree in your front lawn for your mother’s birthday. Your brother kicks a 500 g ball, which hits the top of the tree at a speed of 5 m/s and stays in contact with it for 10 ms. The ball falls to the ground near the base of the tree and the recoil of the tree is minimal.
(a) What is the force on the tree?
(b) The length of the sturdy section of the root is only 20 cm. Furthermore, the soil around the roots is loose and we can assume that an effective force is applied at the tip of the 20 cm length. What is the effective force exerted by the end of the tip of the root to keep the tree from toppling? Assume the tree will be uprooted rather than bend.
(c) What could you have done to ensure that the tree does not uproot easily?

**Unreasonable Results**


Suppose two children are using a uniform seesaw that is 3.00 m long and has its
center of mass over the pivot. The first child has a mass of 30.0 kg and sits
1.40 m from the pivot.
(a) Calculate where the second 18.0 kg child must sit to balance the seesaw.
(b) What is unreasonable about the result?
(c) Which premise is unreasonable, or which premises are inconsistent?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
a) $$ \overline{x_{2}}=2.33 \m $$ 

b) The seesaw is 3.0 m long, and hence, there is only 1.50 m of board on the
other side of the pivot. The second child is off the board.

c) The position of the first child must be shortened, i.e. brought closer to the
pivot.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider a method for measuring the mass of a person’s arm in anatomical
studies. The subject lies on her back, extends her relaxed arm to the side and
two scales are placed below the arm. One is placed under the elbow and the other
under the back of her hand. Construct a problem in which you calculate the mass
of the arm and find its center of mass based on the scale readings and the
distances of the scales from the shoulder joint. You must include a free body
diagram of the arm to direct the analysis. Consider changing the position of the
scale under the hand to provide more information, if needed. You may wish to
consult references to obtain reasonable mass values.

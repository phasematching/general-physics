### Relative Velocity

If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head
directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves **diagonally** relative to
the shore, as in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1635451). The boat does not move in
the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course, is that the river
carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small airplane flies overhead in a
strong crosswind, you can sometimes see that the plane is not moving in the
direction in which it is pointed, as illustrated
in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1851600). The plane is moving straight ahead
relative to the air, but the movement of the air mass relative to the ground
carries it sideways.

![A boat is trying to cross a river. Due to the velocity of river the path traveled by boat is diagonal. The velocity of boat v boat is in positive y direction. The velocity of river v river is in positive x direction. The resultant diagonal velocity v total which makes an angle of theta with the horizontal x axis is towards north east direction.](../resources/Figure_03_05_01a.jpg "A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity (solid arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the river plus the velocity of the river relative to the shore.")

![An airplane is trying to fly straight north with velocity v sub p. Due to wind velocity v sub w in south west direction making an angle theta with the horizontal axis, the plane&#x2019;s total velocity is thirty eight point 0 meters per seconds oriented twenty degrees west of north.](../resources/Figure_03_05_02a.jpg "An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative to the ground in the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total velocity (solid arrow).")
{: #import-auto-id1851600}

In each of these situations, an object has a **velocity**{: class="term"#import-auto-id1831655}
relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium
has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground. The velocity of the
object **relative to the observer** is the sum of these velocity vectors, as
indicated in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1635451)
and [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1851600). These situations are only two of many in
which it is useful to add velocities. In this module, we first re-examine how to
add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity
means.

How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude and
direction); the rules of **vector addition**{: class="term"
#import-auto-id1402169} discussed
in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods](../contents/ch3VectorAdditionAndSubtractionGraphicalMethods.md)
and [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](../contents/ch3VectorAdditionAndSubtractionAnalyticalMethods.md)
apply to the addition of velocities, just as they do for any other vectors. In
one-dimensional motion, the addition of velocities is simple—they add like
ordinary numbers. For example, if a field hockey player is moving at $$
5 \ms $$ straight toward the goal and drives the ball in the same
direction with a velocity of $$ 30 \ms $$ relative to her body, then the
velocity of the ball is $$ 35 \ms $$ relative to the stationary,
profusely sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal.

In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can be used
to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques. The following
equations give the relationships between the magnitude and direction of
velocity ( $$ v $$ and $$ \theta $$ ) and its components ( $$ v_{x} $$ and $$ v_
{y} $$ ) along the **x**- and **y**-axes of an appropriately chosen coordinate
system:

<div class="equation" id="eip-343">
 $$ v_{x}=v\cos{\theta} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" id="eip-859">
 $$ v_{y}=v\sin{\theta} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" id="eip-505">
 $$ v=\sqrt{ v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}} $$
</div>

<div class="equation" id="eip-213">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(v_{y}/v_{x}\right). $$
</div>

![The figure shows components of velocity v in horizontal x axis v x and in
vertical y axis v y. The angle between the velocity vector v and the
horizontal axis is theta.](../resources/Figure_03_05_03a.jpg "The velocity, \( \vb{v} \)
of an object traveling at an angle \( \theta \) to the horizontal
axis is the sum of component vectors .")
{: #import-auto-id1382383}

These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically for
velocity. The first two equations are used to find the components of a velocity
when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are used to find the
magnitude and direction of velocity when its components are known.

Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River

![A boat is trying to cross a river. Due to the velocity of the river the path traveled by the boat is diagonal. The velocity of the boat, v boat, is equal to zero point seven five meters per second and is in positive y direction. The velocity of the river, v-river, is equal to one point two meters per second and is in positive x direction. The resultant diagonal velocity v total, which makes an angle of theta with the horizontal x axis, is towards north east direction.](../resources/Figure_03_05_09a.jpg "A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed 0.75 m/s. The current in the river, however, flows at a speed of 1.20 m/s to the right. What is the total displacement of the boat relative to the shore?"){: #import-auto-id2070798}

Refer to [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2070798), which shows a boat trying to go
straight across the river. Let us calculate the magnitude and direction of the
boat’s velocity relative to an observer on the shore, $$ \vb{v}_
{\text{tot}} $$. The velocity of the boat, $$ \vb{v}_{\text{boat}}
$$, is 0.75 m/s in the $$ y $$ -direction relative to the river and the velocity
of the river, $$ \vb{v}_{\text{river}} $$, is 1.20 m/s to the
right.

**Strategy**

We start by choosing a coordinate system with its $$ x $$ -axis parallel to the
velocity of the river, as shown in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2070798). Because
the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to
the water is parallel to the $$ y $$ -axis and perpendicular to the velocity of
the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations $$ v_
{\text{tot}}=\sqrt{ v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}} $$ and $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(v_
{y}/v_{x}\right) $$ directly.

**Solution**

The magnitude of the total velocity is

<div class="equation" id="eip-120">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}}=\sqrt{ v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}, $$
</div>
where

<div class="equation" id="eip-845">
 $$ v_{x}=v_{\text{river}}=1.20 \ms $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation" id="eip-311">
 $$ v_{y}=v_{\text{boat}}=0.750 \ms . $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" id="eip-869">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}}=\sqrt{
\left( 1.20 \ms \right)^{2}+
\left( 0.750 \ms \right)^{2}
} $$
</div>
yielding

<div class="equation" id="eip-166">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}}=1.42 \ms . $$
</div>
The direction of the total velocity $$ \theta $$ is given by:

<div class="equation" id="eip-862">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(v_{y}/v_{x}\right)={\tan}^{-1}\left(0.750/1.20\right). $$
</div>
This equation gives

<div class="equation" id="eip-16">
 $$ \theta =32.0^\circ . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Both the magnitude $$ v $$ and the direction $$ \theta $$ of the total velocity
are consistent with [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2070798). Note that because the
velocity of the river is large compared with the velocity of the boat, it is
swept rapidly downstream. This result is evidenced by the small angle (only $$ 32.0^\circ $$)
the total velocity has relative to the riverbank.

Calculating Velocity: Wind Velocity Causes an Airplane to Drift
</div>
Calculate the wind velocity for the situation shown in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1546060). The plane is known to be moving at 45.0 m/s due north relative to the air mass, while its velocity relative to the
ground (its total velocity) is 38.0 m/s in a direction $$20.0^\circ $$ west of north.

![An airplane is trying to fly north with velocity v p equal to forty five meters per second at angle of one hundred and ten degrees but due to wind velocity v w in south west direction making an angle theta with the horizontal axis it reaches a position in north west direction with resultant velocity v total equal to thirty eight meters per second and the direction is twenty degrees west of north.](../resources/Figure_03_05_04a.jpg "An airplane is known to be heading north at 45.0 m/s, though its velocity relative to the ground is 38.0 m/s at an angle  west of north. What is the speed and direction of the wind?")
{: #import-auto-id1546060}

**Strategy**

In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know the total
velocity $$ \vb{v}_{\text{tot}} $$ and that it is the sum of two
other velocities, $$ \vb{v}_{\text{w}} $$
(the wind) and $$ \vb{v}_{\text{p}} $$
(the plane relative to the air mass). The quantity $$ \vb{v}_
{\text{p}} $$ is known, and we are asked to find $$ \vb{v}_
{\text{w}} $$. None of the velocities are perpendicular, but it is possible to
find their components along a common set of perpendicular axes. If we can find
the components of $$ \vb{v}_{\text{w}} $$, then we can combine them
to solve for its magnitude and direction. As shown
in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1546060), we choose a coordinate system with its
*x*-axis due east and its *y*-axis due north (parallel to $$ \vb{v}_
{\text{p}} $$).
 (You may wish to look back at the discussion of the addition of vectors using
perpendicular components
in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](../contents/ch3VectorAdditionAndSubtractionAnalyticalMethods.md).)

**Solution**

Because $$ \vb{v}_{\text{tot}} $$ is the vector sum of the $$
\vb{v}_{\text{w}} $$ and $$ \vb{v}_{\text{p}} $$,
its *x*- and *y*-components are the sums of the *x*- and *y*-components of the
wind and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of
velocity so $$ v_{px}=0 $$ and $$ v_{py}=v_{\text{p}} $$. That is,

<div class="equation" id="eip-190">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}x}=v_{\text{w}x} $$
</div>
and

<div class="equation" id="eip-690">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}y}=v_{\text{w}y}+v_{\text{p}}. $$
</div>
We can use the first of these two equations to find $$ v_{\text{w}x} $$:

<div class="equation" id="eip-615">
 $$ v_{\text{w}x}=v_{\text{tot}x}=v_{\text{tot}}\cos{110^\circ }. $$
</div>
Because $$ v_{\text{tot}}=38.0 \ms $$ and $$ \cos{110^\circ }=-0.342 $$
we have

<div class="equation" id="eip-112">
 $$ v_{\text{w}x}=\left(38.0 \ms \right)\left(-0.342 \right)=-13 \ms . $$
</div>
The minus sign indicates motion west which is consistent with the diagram.

Now, to find $$ v_{\text{w}\text{y}} $$ we note that

<div class="equation" id="eip-142">
 $$ v_{\text{tot}y}=v_{\text{w}y}+v_{\text{p}} $$
</div>
Here $$ v_{\text{tot}y}=v_{\text{tot}}\sin{110^\circ } $$; thus,

<div class="equation" id="eip-206">
 $$ v_{\text{w}y}=\left(38.0 \ms \right)
\left(0.940 \right)-45.0 \ms = -9.29 \ms . $$
</div>
This minus sign indicates motion south which is consistent with the diagram.

Now that the perpendicular components of the wind velocity $$ v_{\text{w}x} $$
and $$ v_{\text{w}y} $$ are known, we can find the magnitude and direction of $$
\vb{v}_{\text{w}} $$. First, the magnitude is

<div class="equation" id="eip-128">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v_{\text{w}}& =& \sqrt{ v_{\text{w}x}^{2}+v_{\text{w}y}^{2}}\\
& =& \sqrt{
\left(-13.0 \ms \right)^{2}+
\left(-9.29 \ms \right)^{2}
}
\end{array} $$
</div>
so that

<div class="equation" id="eip-637">
 $$ v_{\text{w}}=16.0 \ms . $$
</div>
The direction is:

<div class="equation" id="eip-359">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(v_{\text{w}y}/v_{\text{w}x}\right)={\tan}^{-1}\left(-9.29/-13.0\right) $$
</div>
giving

<div class="equation" id="eip-955">
 $$ \theta =35.6^\circ . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The wind’s speed and direction are consistent with the significant effect the
wind has on the total velocity of the plane, as seen
in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1546060). Because the plane is fighting a strong
combination of crosswind and head-wind, it ends up with a total velocity
significantly less than its velocity relative to the air mass as well as heading
in a different direction.

</div>

Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the mathematics
easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis parallel to one of the
velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing an appropriate coordinate
system makes problem solving easier. For example, in projectile motion we always
use a coordinate system with one axis parallel to gravity.

### Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity

When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the **velocity is
relative to some reference frame**. These velocities are called **relative
velocities**{: class="term" #import-auto-id1929302}. For example, the
velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity
relative to the ground. Both are quite different from the velocity of an
airplane relative to its passengers (which should be close to zero). Relative
velocities are one aspect of **relativity**{: class="term"
#import-auto-id1982113}, which is defined to be the study of how different
observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon.

Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it with
Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th century.
Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his **modern** theory of
relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The relative velocities in
this section are actually aspects of classical relativity, first discussed
correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton. **Classical relativity**{: class="
term" #import-auto-id1447237} is limited to situations where speeds are less
than about 1% of the speed of light—that is, less
than $$ 3 000 \text{km/s} $$. Most things we encounter in daily life move slower
than this speed.

Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a situation
analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a mast on a moving
ship drops his binoculars. Where will it hit the deck? Will it hit at the base
of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast because the ship is moving forward?
The answer is that if air resistance is negligible, the binoculars will hit at
the base of the mast at a point directly below its point of release. Now let us
consider what two different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer
is on the ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal
velocity relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight
down the mast. (See [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1892076).) To the observer on
shore, the binoculars and the ship have the **same** horizontal velocity, so
both move the same distance forward while the binoculars are falling. This
observer sees the curved path shown in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1892076).
Although the paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same
result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it. To get the
correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the velocities relative
to the observer.

![A person is observing a moving ship from the shore. Another person is on top of ship&#x2019;s mast. The person in the ship drops binoculars and sees it dropping straight. The person on the shore sees the binoculars taking a curved trajectory.](../resources/Figure_03_05_05a.jpg "Classical relativity. The same motion as viewed by two different observers. An observer on the moving ship sees the binoculars dropped from the top of its mast fall straight down. An observer on shore sees the binoculars take the curved path, moving forward with the ship. Both observers see the binoculars strike the deck at the base of the mast. The initial horizontal velocity is different relative to the two observers. (The ship is shown moving rather fast to emphasize the effect.)")

Calculating Relative Velocity: An Airline Passenger Drops a Coin
</div>
An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at 260 m/s. What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor 1.50 m below its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane?
(b) Measured relative to the Earth?

![A person standing on ground is observing an airplane. Inside the airplane a woman is sitting on seat. The airplane is moving in the right direction. The woman drops the coin which is vertically downwards for her but the person on ground sees the coin moving horizontally towards right.](../resources/Figure_03_05_06a.jpg "The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two different observers. (a) An observer in the plane sees the coin fall straight down.
(b) An observer on the ground sees the coin move almost horizontally.")
{: #import-auto-id1944737 height="350"}

**Strategy**

Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and
projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero relative to
the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object (one-dimensional). In
part (b), the initial velocity is 260 m/s horizontal relative to the Earth and
gravity is vertical, so this motion is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is
best to use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes.

**Solution for (a)**

Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and position are
zero, and the final position is 1.50 m. The final velocity can be found using
the equation:

<div class="equation" id="eip-313">
 $$ v_{y}^{2}=v_{0y}^{2}-2g\left(y-y_{0}\right). $$
</div>
Substituting known values into the equation, we get

<div class="equation" id="eip-444">
 $$ v_{y}^{2}=0^{2}-2\left(9.80\mss \right)
\left(-1.50\m -0 \m \right)=29.4 \mmss $$
</div>
yielding

<div class="equation" id="eip-877">
 $$ v_{y}=-5.42 \ms . $$
</div>
We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We choose
the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed downwards, and we
have defined the positive direction to be upwards. There is no initial horizontal
velocity relative to the plane and no horizontal acceleration, and so the motion
is straight down relative to the plane.

**Solution for (b)**

Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and
vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical velocity
for the coin relative to the ground is $$ v_{y}=-5.42 \ms $$, the same as
found in part (a). In contrast to part (a), there now is a horizontal component
of the velocity. However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial
and final horizontal velocities are the same and $$ v_{x}=260 \ms $$.
The *x*- and *y*-components of velocity can be combined to find the magnitude of
the final velocity:

<div class="equation" id="eip-558">
 $$ v=\sqrt{ v_{x}^{2}+ v_{y}^{2} }. $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" id="eip-842">
 $$ v=\sqrt{\left(260 \ms \right)^{2}+\left(-5.42 \ms \right)^{2} } $$
</div>
yielding

<div class="equation" id="eip-98">
 $$ v=260.06 \ms . $$
</div>
The direction is given by:

<div class="equation" id="eip-73">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(v_{y}/v_{x}\right)={\tan}^{-1}\left(-5.42/260 \right) $$
</div>
so that

<div class="equation" id="eip-328">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(-0.0208\right)=-1.19^\circ. $$
</div>

**Discussion**

In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it would be
if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell 1.50 m. This result
fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way when the plane is
flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the ground. This result is also
true in moving cars. In part (b), an observer on the ground sees a much
different motion for the coin. The plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin
with that its final velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once
again, we see that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary
numbers—the final velocity v in part (b) is **not** $$ \left(260 - 5.42\right)
 \ms $$; rather, it is $$ 260.06 \ms $$. The velocity’s magnitude
had to be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the
airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane and one
on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed for the
binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that the velocity of
the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see **very** different
paths. (See [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1944737).) In addition, both observers see
the coin fall 1.50 m vertically, but the one on the ground also sees it move
forward 144 m (this calculation is left for the reader).
Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly horizontal path.

The great astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies are receding from our Milky Way Galaxy with velocities proportional to their distances. It appears to an observer on the Earth that we are at the center of an expanding universe. [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1915192) illustrates this for five galaxies lying along a straight line, with the Milky Way Galaxy at the center. Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities:
(a) relative to galaxy 2 and
(b) relative to galaxy 5. The results mean that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of expansion with the given information.

![Five galaxies on a horizontal straight line are shown. The left most galaxy one has distance of three hundred millions of light years and it is moving towards left. The second and third galaxies in the figure have shown no velocities. The velocities of fourth and fifth galaxies are towards right.](../resources/Figure_03_05_07.jpg "Five galaxies on a straight line, showing their distances and velocities relative to the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider an airplane headed for a runway in a cross wind. Construct a problem in which you calculate the angle the airplane must fly relative to the air mass in order to have a velocity parallel to the runway. Among the things to consider are the direction of the runway, the wind speed and direction (its velocity) and the speed of the plane relative to the air mass. Also calculate the speed of the airplane relative to the ground. Discuss any last minute maneuvers the pilot might have to perform in order for the plane to land with its wheels pointing straight down the runway.

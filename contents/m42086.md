<div data-type="abstract" markdown="1">
* Calculate coefficient of friction on a car tire.
* Calculate ideal speed and angle of a car on a turn.

</div>

Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial
acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball,
the force of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, friction between roller skates and a
rink floor, a banked roadway’s force on a car, and forces on the tube of a
spinning centrifuge.

Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a **centripetal force**
{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3450370}. The direction of a centripetal
force is toward the center of curvature, the same as the
direction of centripetal acceleration. According to Newton’s second law of
motion, net force is mass times acceleration:
net $$ F=ma $$. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is the
centripetal acceleration— $$a=a_{c}$$. Thus, 
the magnitude of centripetal force  $$\text{F}_{\text{c}} $$ is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-696">
$$ \text{F}_{\text{c}}= m \text{a}_{\text{c}}. $$
</div>

By using the expressions for centripetal acceleration $$ a_{c}$$ from $$a_
{c}=\frac{ v^{2}}{r};a_{c}=r \omega^{2}$$, we get two expressions for the
centripetal force $${\text{F}}_{\text{c}} $$ in terms of mass, velocity, angular
velocity, and radius of curvature:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-562">
 $$ F_{c}=m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}; F_{c}=m r \omega^{2}. $$ 
</div>

You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient.
Centripetal force $$ F_{\text{c}} $$ is always perpendicular to the path and
pointing to the center of curvature, because $$ {\mathbf{a}}_{c} $$ is
perpendicular to the velocity and pointing to the center of curvature.

Note that if you solve the first expression for $$ r $$ , you get
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-58">
$$ r=\frac{ mv^{2}}{ F_{c}}. $$
</div>

This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force
causes a small radius of curvature—that is, a tight curve.

![The given figure consists of two semicircles, one over the other. The top semicircle is bigger and the one below is smaller. In both the figures, the direction of the path is given along the semicircle in the counter-clockwise direction. A point is shown on the path, where the radius from the circle, r, is shown with an arrow from the center of the circle. At the same point, the centripetal force is shown in the opposite direction to that of radius arrow. The velocity, v, is shown along this point in the left upward direction and is perpendicular to the force. In both the figures, the velocity is same, but the radius is smaller and centripetal force is larger in the lower figure.](../resources/Figure_07_03_01a.jpg "The frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it.

What Coefficient of Friction Do Car Tires Need on a Flat Curve?
</div>
(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900 kg car that negotiates a 500 m radius curve at 25.0 m/s.

(b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction,
between the tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the
car from slipping (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3184285)).

**Strategy and Solution for (a)**

We know that $$ F_{\text{c}}=\frac{ m v^{2} }{r} $$ .
Thus, 
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-211">
$$ F_{\text{c}}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
=\frac{\left( 900 \text{kg} \right)
\left(25.0 \text{m/s} \right)^{2}}
{\left(500 \text{m}\right)}=1125 \text{N} . $$
</div>

**Strategy for (b)**

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id3184285) shows the forces acting on the car on an
unbanked (level ground) curve. Friction is to the left, keeping the car from
slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the
friction is the centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static
friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is $$ \mu_{\text{s}}N $$,
where $$ \mu_{\text{s}} $$ is the static coefficient of friction and N is the
normal force. The normal force equals the car’s weight on level ground, so that
$$ N=mg $$. Thus the centripetal force in this situation is
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-109">
$$ F_{\text{c}}=f=\mu_{\text{s}} N=\mu_{\text{s}} mg . $$ 
</div>
Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction.
Using the first expression for $$ F_{\text{c}} $$ 
 from the equation
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-735">
$$ \begin{array}{c}
{F}_{\text{c}}=m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\\
{F}_{\text{c}}= mr \omega^{2} 
\end{array}, $$ 
</div>

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-18">
 $$ m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}=\mu_{\text{s}}mg . $$ 
</div>

We solve this for  $$ \mu_{\text{s}}$$ , noting that mass cancels, and 
obtain 

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-99"> 
$$ \mu_{\text{s}}=\frac{ v^{2}}{\text{rg}}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Substituting the knowns, 

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-971">
$$ \mu_{\text{s}}=\frac{\left(25.0 \text{m/s}\right)^{2}} {\left(500
\text{m}\right)\left(9.80 \text{m/s}^{2}\right)}=0.13. $$ 
</div> 
(Because
coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two
digits.)

**Discussion**

We could also solve part (a) using the first expression in 
$$
\left.
\begin{array}{c}
F_{\text{c}}=m\frac{ v^{2}}{r}\\ 
F_{\text{c}}=mr\omega^{2}
\end{array}
\right\} 
,
$$
because $$m$$, $$v$$, and $$r$$  are given. The coefficient of friction found 
in part (b) is much smaller than is
typically found between tires and roads. The car will still negotiate the curve
if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a responsive
force, being able to assume a value less than but no more than $\mu_{\text{s}}N
$$ . A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the curve at a
higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would
be less than 25 m/s. Note that mass cancels, implying that in this example, it
does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn. Mass
cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in
turn is proportional to mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the normal
force would be less as will be discussed below. </div>

![In the given figure, a car is shown from the back, which is turning to the left. The weight, w, of the car is shown with a down arrow and N with an up arrow at the back of the car. At the right rear wheel, centripetal force is shown along with its equation formula in a leftward horizontal arrow. The free-body diagram shows three vectors, one upward, depicting N, one downward, depicting w, and one leftward, depicting centripetal force.](../resources/Figure_07_03_02a.jpg "This car on level ground is moving away and turning to the left. The centripetal force causing the car to turn in a circular path is due to friction between the tires and the road. A minimum coefficient of friction is needed, or the car will move in a larger-radius curve and leave the roadway.")
{: #import-auto-id3184285}

Let us now consider **banked curves**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id2403430}, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the
curve. See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1571739). The greater the angle $$ \theta
$$, the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars,
for example, often have steeply banked curves. In an “ideally banked curve,” the
angle $$ \theta $$ is such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain speed
without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an
expression for $$ \theta $$ for an ideally banked curve and consider an example
related to it.

For **ideal banking**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1402139}, the net
external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of
friction. The components of the normal force N in the horizontal and vertical
directions must equal the centripetal force and the weight of the car,
respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient
to consider components along perpendicular axes—in this case, the vertical and
horizontal directions.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1571739) shows a free body diagram for a car on a
frictionless banked curve. If the angle $$ \theta $$ is ideal for the speed and
radius, then the net external force will equal the necessary centripetal force.
The only two external forces acting on the car are its weight $$ \mathbf{w} $$
and the normal force of the road $$ \mathbf{N} $$. (A frictionless surface can
only exert a force perpendicular to the surface—that is, a normal force.) These
two forces must add to give a net external force that is horizontal toward the
center of curvature and has magnitude $$ m v^{2}\text{/r} $$. Because this is
the crucial force and it is horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical
and horizontal axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal component, and so
this must equal the centripetal force—that is,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-584">
 $$ N\sin{\theta} =\frac{ mv^{2}}{r}. $$ 
</div>

Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force
must be zero, meaning that the vertical components of the two external forces
must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From the figure, we see
that the vertical component of the normal force is $$ N\cos{\theta} $$, and the
only other vertical force is the car’s weight. These must be equal in magnitude;
thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-125">
 $$ N\cos{\theta} =mg . $$ 
</div>

Now we can combine the last two equations to eliminate $$ N $$ and get an
expression for $$ \theta $$, as desired. Solving the second equation for 
$$ N=mg/\left( \cos{\theta} \right) $$, 
and substituting this into the first yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-713">
 $$ mg \frac{\sin{\theta} }{\cos{\theta} }=\frac{ m v^{2}}{r} $$ 
</div>

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-285">
 $$ \begin{array}{rrr}mg \tan\left(\theta \right)& =& \frac{ mv^{2}}{r}\\ \tan{\theta} & =& \frac{ v^{2}}{\text{rg.}}
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

Taking the inverse tangent gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-239">
 $$ \theta ={\tan}^{-1}\left(\frac{ v^{2}}{\text{rg}}\right)\text{(ideally banked curve, no friction).} $$ 
</div>

This expression can be understood by considering how $$ \theta $$ depends on 
$$v$$
and $$r$$ . A large $$\theta $$ will be obtained for a large $$v$$ and a small 
$$r$$ .
That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction
helps, because it allows you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if
the curve is frictionless. Note that $$\theta $$ does not depend on the mass of
the vehicle.

![In this figure, a car from the backside is shown, turning to the left, on a slope angling downward to the left. A point in the middle of the back of the car is shown which shows one downward vector depicting weight, w, and an upward arrow depicting force N, which is a linear line along the car and is at an angle theta with the straight up arrow. The slope is at an angle theta with the horizontal surface below the slope. The force values, N multiply sine theta equals to centripetal force, the net force on the car and N cosine theta equal to w are given below the car. ](../resources/Figure_07_03_03a.jpg "The car on this banked curve is moving away and turning to the left.")

What Is the Ideal Speed to Take a Steeply Banked Tight Curve?
</div>
Curves on some test tracks and race courses, such as the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100 m radius curve banked at 65.0° should be driven if the road is frictionless.

**Strategy**

We first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked
curve except for speed are known; thus, we need only rearrange it so that speed
appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.

**Solution**

Starting with

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-895">
 $$ \tan{\theta} =\frac{ v^{2}}{\text{rg}} $$ 
</div>
we get

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-6">
 $$ v=\sqrt{rg \tan{\theta}}. $$ 
</div>
Noting that $$\tan{65.0^\circ } = 2.14 $$, we obtain

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-571">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}v& =& {\left[\left(100 \text{m}\right)
\left(9.80 \text{m/s}^{2}\right)\left(2.14\right)\right]}^{1/2}\\ & =& 
45.8 \text{ m/s} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This is just about 165 km/h, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather
sharp curve. Tire friction enables a vehicle to take the curve at significantly
higher speeds.

Calculations similar to those in the preceding examples can be performed for a
host of interesting situations in which centripetal force is involved—a number
of these are presented in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

At what angle $$ \theta $$ below the horizontal will the cage hang when the
centripetal acceleration is $$ 10 g $$ ? (Hint: The arm supplies centripetal
force and supports the weight of the cage. Draw a free body diagram of the
forces to see what the angle $$ \theta $$ should be.)

![Figure a shows a NASA centrifuge n a big hall. In figure b, there is a girl sitting in the cage of the centrifuge. The centripetal force on the cage is directed toward left. The direction of the weight of the cage is downward and the force on the arm is directed in north-west direction.](../resources/Figure_07_03_09a.jpg "(a) NASA centrifuge used to subject trainees to accelerations similar to those experienced in rocket launches and reentries.

**Integrated Concepts**

If a car takes a banked curve at less than the ideal speed, friction is needed
to keep it from sliding toward the inside of the curve (a real problem on icy
mountain roads). (a) Calculate the ideal speed to take a 100 m radius curve
banked at $$15.0^\circ $$. (b) What is the minimum coefficient of friction
needed for a frightened driver to take the same curve at 20.0 km/h?

Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in [[link]](#import-auto-id2514816). The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. What is the speed of the roller coaster at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is 15.0 m and the downward acceleration of the car is 1.50 g?

![A teardrop shaped loop of a roller coaster is shown. The car of the roller coaster starts from the point A near the right of the base and covers the teardrop portion of the roller coaster and move to a point D at the left of base. Near the top of tear drop portion an upward arrow is shown labeled as r-minimum. Also at a point near the base toward A there is a label called r-maximum. The wire frame of the base is also shown.](../resources/Figure_07_03_10a.jpg "Teardrop-shaped loops are used in the latest roller coasters so that the radius of curvature gradually decreases to a minimum at the top. This means that the centripetal acceleration builds from zero to a maximum at the top and gradually decreases again. A circular loop would cause a jolting change in acceleration at entry, a disadvantage discovered long ago in railroad curve design. With a small radius of curvature at the top, the centripetal acceleration can more easily be kept greater than &#10; &#10; &#10; g&#10; &#10; &#10; so that the passengers do not lose contact with their seats nor do they need seat belts to keep them in place.")

### Material and Shape Dependence of Resistance

The resistance of an object depends on its shape and the material of which it is composed. The cylindrical resistor in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1351234) is easy to analyze, and, by so doing, we can gain insight into the resistance of more complicated shapes. As you might expect, the cylinder’s electric resistance  $$R $$
 is directly proportional to its length  $$L $$ ,
 similar to the resistance of a pipe to fluid flow. The longer the cylinder, the more collisions charges will make with its atoms. The greater the diameter of the cylinder, the more current it can carry (again similar to the flow of fluid through a pipe). In fact,  $$R $$
 is inversely proportional to the cylinder’s cross-sectional area  $$A $$.

 ![A cylindrical conductor of length L and cross section A is shown. The resistivity of the cylindrical section is represented as rho. The resistance of this cross section R is equal to rho L divided by A. The section of length L of cylindrical conductor is shown equivalent to a resistor represented by symbol R.](../resources/Figure_21_03_01a.jpg "A uniform cylinder of length \( L \)  and cross-sectional area \( A \) . Its resistance to the flow of current is similar to the resistance posed by a pipe to fluid flow. The longer the cylinder, the greater its resistance. The larger its cross-sectional area \( A \) , the smaller its resistance."){: #import-auto-id1351234}

For a given shape, the resistance depends on the material of which the object is composed. Different materials offer different resistance to the flow of charge. We define the **resistivity**  $$\rho  $$
 of a substance so that the **resistance**  $$R $$
 of an object is directly proportional to  $$\rho  $$ .
 Resistivity  $$\rho  $$
 is an <em><em>intrinsic </em></em> property of a material, independent of its shape or size. The resistance  $$R $$
 of a uniform cylinder of length  $$L $$ ,
 of cross-sectional area  $$A $$ ,
 and made of a material with resistivity  $$\rho  $$, is 

<div class="equation" id="eip-867">
 $$R=\frac{\rho L}{A}\text{.} $$
</div>

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1375921) gives representative values of  $$\rho  $$ .
 The materials listed in the table are separated into categories of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, based on broad groupings of resistivities. Conductors have the smallest resistivities, and insulators have the largest; semiconductors have intermediate resistivities. Conductors have varying but large free charge densities, whereas most charges in insulators are bound to atoms and are not free to move. Semiconductors are intermediate, having far fewer free charges than conductors, but having properties that make the number of free charges depend strongly on the type and amount of impurities in the semiconductor. These unique properties of semiconductors are put to use in modern electronics, as will be explored in later chapters.

Calculating Resistor Diameter: A Headlight Filament
</div>
A car headlight filament is made of tungsten and has a cold resistance of  $$ 0.350 \Omega  $$ .
 If the filament is a cylinder 4.00 cm long (it may be coiled to save space), what is its diameter?

**Strategy**

We can rearrange the equation  $$R=\frac{\rho L}{A} $$
 to find the cross-sectional area  $$A $$
 of the filament from the given information. Then its diameter can be found by assuming it has a circular cross-section.

**Solution**

The cross-sectional area, found by rearranging the expression for the resistance of a cylinder given in  $$R=\frac{\rho L}{A} $$, is 
<div class="equation" id="eip-462">
 $$A=\frac{\rho L}{R}\text{.} $$
</div>
Substituting the given values, and taking  $$\rho  $$
 from [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1375921), yields

<div class="equation" id="eip-614">
 $$\begin{array}{lll}A& =& \frac{\left(5.6 \times 10^{-8} \Omega \cdot \text{m}\right)\left(4.00 \times 10^{-2} \text{m}\right)}{0.350 \Omega }\\ & =& 6.40 \times 10^{-9} {\text{m}}^{2}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
The area of a circle is related to its diameter  $$D $$
 by

<div class="equation" id="eip-83">
 $$A=\frac{ \pi D^{2}}{4}\text{.} $$
</div>
Solving for the diameter  $$D $$ ,
 and substituting the value found for  $$A $$, gives 
<div class="equation" id="eip-474">
 $$\begin{array}{lll}D& =& 2{\left(\frac{A}{p}\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}=2{\left(\frac{6.40 \times 10^{-9} {\text{m}}^{2}}{3.14}\right)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\\ & =& 9.0 \times 10^{-5} \text{m}\text{.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The diameter is just under a tenth of a millimeter. It is quoted to only two digits, because  $$\rho  $$
 is known to only two digits.

### Temperature Variation of Resistance

The resistivity of all materials depends on temperature. Some even become superconductors (zero resistivity) at very low temperatures. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3201924).) Conversely, the resistivity of conductors increases with increasing temperature. Since the atoms vibrate more rapidly and over larger distances at higher temperatures, the electrons moving through a metal make more collisions, effectively making the resistivity higher. Over relatively small temperature changes (about  $$100 \text{ºC} $$
 or less), resistivity  $$\rho  $$
 varies with temperature change  $$\Delta T $$
 as expressed in the following equation

<div class="equation" id="eip-981">
 $$\rho ={\rho }_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right)\text{,} $$
</div>

where  $${\rho }_{0} $$
 is the original resistivity and  $$\alpha  $$
 is the **temperature coefficient of resistivity**. (See the values of  $$\alpha  $$
 in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1382426) below.) For larger temperature changes,  $$\alpha  $$
 may vary or a nonlinear equation may be needed to find  $$\rho  $$ .
 Note that  $$\alpha  $$
 is positive for metals, meaning their resistivity increases with temperature. Some alloys have been developed specifically to have a small temperature dependence. Manganin (which is made of copper, manganese and nickel), for example, has  $$\alpha  $$
** close to zero (to three digits on the scale in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1382426)), and so its resistivity varies only slightly with temperature. This is useful for making a temperature-independent resistance standard, for example.

 ![A graph for variation of resistance R with temperature T for a mercury sample is shown. The temperature T is plotted along the x axis and is measured in Kelvin, and the resistance R is plotted along the y axis and is measured in ohms. The curve starts at x equals zero and y equals zero, and coincides with the X axis until the value of temperature is four point two Kelvin, known as the critical temperature T sub c. At temperature T sub c, the curve shows a vertical rise, represented by a dotted line, until the resistance is about zero point one one ohms. After this temperature the resistance shows a nearly linear increase with temperature T.](../resources/Figure_21_03_02a.jpg "The resistance of a sample of mercury is zero at very low temperatures&#x2014;it is a superconductor up to about 4.2 K.

Note also that  $$\alpha  $$
 is negative for the semiconductors listed in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1382426), meaning that their resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. They become better conductors at higher temperature, because increased thermal agitation increases the number of free charges available to carry current. This property of decreasing  $$\rho  $$
 with temperature is also related to the type and amount of impurities present in the semiconductors.

The resistance of an object also depends on temperature, since  $${R}_{0} $$
 is directly proportional to  $$\rho  $$ .
 For a cylinder we know  $$R=\rho L/A $$ ,
 and so, if  $$L $$
 and  $$A $$
 do not change greatly with temperature,  $$R $$
 will have the same temperature dependence as  $$\rho  $$ .
 (Examination of the coefficients of linear expansion shows them to be about two orders of magnitude less than typical temperature coefficients of resistivity, and so the effect of temperature on  $$L $$
 and  $$A $$
 is about two orders of magnitude less than on  $$\rho  $$ .)
 Thus,

<div class="equation" id="eip-145">
 $$R={R}_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$
</div>

is the temperature dependence of the resistance of an object, where  $${R}_{0} $$
 is the original resistance and  $$R $$
 is the resistance after a temperature change  $$\Delta T $$ .
 Numerous thermometers are based on the effect of temperature on resistance. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1568367).) One of the most common is the thermistor, a semiconductor crystal with a strong temperature dependence, the resistance of which is measured to obtain its temperature. The device is small, so that it quickly comes into thermal equilibrium with the part of a person it touches.

Calculating Resistance: Hot-Filament Resistance
</div>
Although caution must be used in applying  $$\rho ={\rho }_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$
 and  $$R={R}_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$
 for temperature changes greater than  $$100 \text{ºC} $$ ,
 for tungsten the equations work reasonably well for very large temperature changes. What, then, is the resistance of the tungsten filament in the previous example if its temperature is increased from room temperature ( $$20 \text{ºC} $$ ) 
to a typical operating temperature of  $$2850 \text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy**

This is a straightforward application of  $$R={R}_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$ ,
 since the original resistance of the filament was given to be  $${R}_{0}=0.350 \text{Ω} $$ ,
 and the temperature change is  $$\Delta T=2830 \text{ºC} $$.

**Solution**

The hot resistance  $$R $$
 is obtained by entering known values into the above equation:

<div class="equation" id="eip-256">
 $$\begin{array}{lll}R& =& {R}_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right)\\ 
& =& \left(0.350 \text{Ω}\right)\left[1+\left(4.5 \times 10^{-3}/\text{ºC}\right)\left(2830 \text{ºC}\right)\right]\\ 
& =& 4.8 \text{Ω.}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This value is consistent with the headlight resistance example in [Ohm’s Law: Resistance and Simple Circuits](/m42344).

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id3017858} The resistance
   $$R $$ of a cylinder of length
   $$L $$ and cross-sectional area
   $$A $$ is
   $$R=\frac{\rho L}{A} $$ ,  where
   $$\rho  $$ is the resistivity of the material.
* {: #import-auto-id2684104} Values of
   $$\rho  $$ in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1375921) show that materials fall into three groups—*conductors, semiconductors, and insulators*.
* {: #import-auto-id3008174} Temperature affects resistivity; for relatively small temperature changes
   $$\Delta T $$ ,  resistivity is
   $$\rho ={\rho }_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$ ,  where
   $${\rho }_{0} $$ is the original resistivity and
   $$\text{α} $$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity.
* {: #import-auto-id1071925} [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1382426) gives values for
   $$\alpha  $$ ,  the temperature coefficient of resistivity.
* {: #import-auto-id1609529} The resistance
   $$R $$ of an object also varies with temperature:
   $$R={R}_{0}\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right) $$ ,  where
   $${R}_{0} $$ is the original resistance, and
   $$R $$ is the resistance after the temperature change.

Does the resistance of an object depend on the path current takes through it? Consider, for example, a rectangular bar—is its resistance the same along its length as across its width? (See [[link]](#import-auto-id1435027).)

![Part a of the figure shows a voltage V applied along the length of a rectangular bar using a battery. The current is shown to emerge from the positive terminal, pass along the length of the rectangular bar, and enter the negative terminal of the battery. The resistance of the rectangular bar along the length is shown as R and the current is shown as I. Part b of the figure shows a voltage V applied along the width of the same rectangular bar using a battery. The current is shown to emerge from the positive terminal, pass along the width of the rectangular bar, and enter the negative terminal of the battery.

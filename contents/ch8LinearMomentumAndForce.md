### Linear Momentum

The scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people’s
intuitive understanding of momentum: a large, fast-moving object has greater
momentum than a smaller, slower object. **Linear momentum** is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied
by its velocity. In symbols, linear
momentum is expressed as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{p}=m\vb{v}. $$
</div>

Momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass and also its velocity.
Thus the greater an object’s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its
momentum. Momentum $$ \vb{p} $$ is a vector having the same direction as the
velocity $$ \vb{v} $$. The SI unit for momentum is $$
\kg · \ms $$.

Calculating Momentum: A Football Player and a Football
</div>
(a) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s.
(b) Compare the player’s momentum with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a speed of 25.0 m/s.

**Strategy**

No information is given regarding direction, and so we can calculate only the
magnitude of the momentum, $$ p $$. (As usual, a symbol that is in italics is a
magnitude, whereas one that is italicized, boldfaced, and has an arrow is a
vector.) In both parts of this example, the magnitude of momentum can be
calculated directly from the definition of momentum given in the equation, which
becomes

<div class="equation">
 $$ p=mv $$
</div>
when only magnitudes are considered.

**Solution for (a)**

To determine the momentum of the player, substitute the known values for the
player’s mass and speed into the equation.

<div class="equation">
 $$ p_{\text{player}}=\left(110 \kg \right)\left(8.00  \ms \right)=880 \kg · \ms $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

To determine the momentum of the ball, substitute the known values for the
ball’s mass and speed into the equation.

<div class="equation">
 $$ p_{\text{ball}}=\left(0.410 \kg \right)\left(25.0  \ms \right)=10.3 \kg · \ms $$
</div>
The ratio of the player’s momentum to that of the ball is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{ p_{\text{player}}}{ p_{\text{ball}}}=\frac{880}{10.3}=85.9 . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Thus
the momentum of the player is much greater than the momentum of the football, as
you might guess. As a result, the player’s motion is only slightly affected if
he catches the ball. We shall quantify what happens in such collisions in terms
of momentum in later sections.

### Momentum and Newton’s Second Law

The importance of momentum, unlike the importance of energy, was recognized
early in the development of classical physics. Momentum was deemed so important
that it was called the “quantity of motion.” Newton actually stated his **second
law of motion** in terms of momentum:
The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the
time over which it changes. Using symbols, this law is

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}, $$
</div>

where $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}} $$ is the net external force, $$ \Delta
\vb{p} $$ is the change in momentum, and $$ \Delta t $$ is the change in
time.

Newton’s Second Law of Motion in Terms of Momentum
</div>
The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t} $$
</div>

<div class="title">
Making Connections: Force and Momentum
</div>
Force and momentum are intimately related. Force acting over time can change momentum, and Newton’s second law of motion, can be stated in its most broadly applicable form in terms of momentum. Momentum continues to be a key concept in the study of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics.

</div>

This statement of Newton’s second law of motion includes the more familiar $$
\vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$ as a special case. We can derive this
form as follows. First, note that the change in momentum $$ \Delta \vb{p} $$
is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \vb{p}=\Delta \left(m\vb{v}\right). $$
</div>

If the mass of the system is constant, then

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta \left(m\vb{v}\right)=m\Delta \vb{v}. $$
</div>

So that for constant mass, Newton’s second law of motion becomes

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}=\frac{m\Delta \vb{v}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>

Because $$ \frac{ \Delta \vb{v}}{\Delta t}=\vb{a} $$, we get the familiar
equation

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=m\vb{a} $$
</div>

*when the mass of the system is constant*.

Newton’s second law of motion stated in terms of momentum is more generally
applicable because it can be applied to systems where the mass is changing, such
as rockets, as well as to systems of constant mass. We will consider systems
with varying mass in some detail**;** however, the relationship between momentum
and force remains useful when mass is constant, such as in the following
example.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Force: Venus Williams’ Racquet
</div>
During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in
a premier women’s match, reaching a speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average
force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by Venus Williams’ racquet, assuming
that the ball’s speed just after impact is 58 m/s, that the initial horizontal
component of the velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained
in contact with the racquet for 5.0 ms (milliseconds)?

**Strategy**

This problem involves only one dimension because the ball starts from having no
horizontal velocity component before impact. Newton’s second law stated in terms
of momentum is then written as

<div class="equation">
 $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{p}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>
As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \Delta p=m\Delta v=m\left(v_{f}-v_{i}\right). $$
</div>
In this example, the velocity just after impact and the change in time are
given; thus, once $$ \Delta p $$ is calculated,
$$ F_{\text{net}}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} $$ can be used to find
the force.

**Solution**

To determine the change in momentum, substitute the values for the initial and
final velocities into the equation above.

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta p &=& m \left( v_{f} - v_{i} \right)\\
\Delta p &=& \left(0.057 \kg \right)\left(58  \ms -0 \ms \right)\\
\Delta p &=& 3.306 \kg · \ms \approx 3.3 \kg · \ms
\end{array} $$
</div>
Now the magnitude of the net external force can determined by
using $$ F_{\text{net}}=\frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta t} $$:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
F_{\text{net}}&=& \frac{ \Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{3.306 \kg \cdot  \ms }{5.0\times 10^{-3}s}\\
F_{\text{net}}&=& 661 \N \approx 660  \text{N,}
\end{array} $$
</div>
where we have retained only two significant figures in the final step.

**Discussion**

This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams’ racquet on the
tennis ball during its brief impact (note that the ball also experienced the
0.56-N force of gravity, but that force was not due to the racquet). This
problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using $$
F_{\text{net}}=ma $$, but one additional step would be required compared with
the strategy used in this example.

</div>

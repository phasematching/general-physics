The flicker of numbers on a handheld calculator, nerve impulses carrying signals
of vision to the brain, an ultrasound device sending a signal to a computer
screen, the brain sending a message for a baby to twitch its toes, an electric
train pulling its load over a mountain pass, a hydroelectric plant sending
energy to metropolitan and rural users—these and many other examples of
electricity involve *electric current, the movement of charge*. Humankind has
indeed harnessed electricity, the basis of technology, to improve our quality of
life. Whereas the previous two chapters concentrated on static electricity and
the fundamental force underlying its behavior, the next few chapters will be
devoted to electric and magnetic phenomena involving current. In addition to
exploring applications of electricity, we shall gain new insights into nature—in
particular, the fact that all magnetism results from electric current.

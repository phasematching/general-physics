Motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, causing us to marvel
at the forces needed to achieve spectacular motion, such as that of a dolphin
jumping out of the water, or a pole vaulter, or the flight of a bird, or the
orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is kinematics, but kinematics only
*describes* the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration.
**Dynamics** considers the forces
that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion
are the foundation of dynamics. These laws provide an example of the breadth and
simplicity of principles under which nature functions. They are also universal
laws in that they apply to similar situations on Earth as well as in space.

Isaac Newton’s (1642–1727) laws of motion were just one part of the monumental
work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton’s laws marks the
transition from the Renaissance into the modern era. This transition was
characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought about the
physical universe. For many centuries natural philosophers had debated the
nature of the universe based largely on certain rules of logic with great weight
given to the thoughts of earlier classical philosophers such as Aristotle (
384–322 BC). Among the many great thinkers who contributed to this change were
Newton and Galileo.

Galileo was instrumental in establishing *observation* as the absolute
determinant of truth, rather than “logical” argument. Galileo’s use of the
telescope was his most notable achievement in demonstrating the importance of
observation. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and made other observations
that were inconsistent with certain ancient ideas and religious dogma. For this
reason, and because of the manner in which he dealt with those in authority,
Galileo was tried by the Inquisition and punished. He spent the final years of
his life under a form of house arrest. Because others before Galileo had also
made discoveries by *observing* the nature of the universe, and because repeated
observations verified those of Galileo, his work could not be suppressed or
denied. After his death, his work was verified by others, and his ideas were
eventually accepted by the church and scientific communities.

Galileo also contributed to the formation of what is now called Newton’s first
law of motion. Newton made use of the work of his predecessors, which enabled
him to develop laws of motion, discover the law of gravity, invent calculus, and
make great contributions to the theories of light and color. It is amazing that
many of these developments were made with Newton working alone, without the
benefit of the usual interactions that take place among scientists today.

It was not until the advent of modern physics early in the 20th century that it
was discovered that Newton’s laws of motion produce a good approximation to
motion only when the objects are moving at speeds much, much less than the speed
of light and when those objects are larger than the size of most molecules (
about $$ 10^{-9}\m $$ in diameter). These constraints define the realm of
classical mechanics, as discussed
in [Introduction to the Nature of Science and Physics](../contents/ch1IntroductionTheNatureOfScienceAndPhysics.md). At the
beginning of the 20th
century, Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed the theory of relativity and,
along with many other scientists, developed quantum theory. This theory does not
have the constraints present in classical physics. All of the situations we
consider in this chapter are in the realm of classical
physics.

*The importance of observation* and the concept of *cause and effect* were not always so entrenched in human thinking. This realization was a part of the evolution of modern physics from natural philosophy. The achievements of Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and others were key milestones in the history of scientific thought. Most of the scientific theories that are described in this book descended from the work of these scientists.

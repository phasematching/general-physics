Before looking at all the particles we now know about, let us examine some of
the machines that created them. The fundamental process in creating previously
unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or
electrons, and direct a beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target
nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by
Rutherford using energetic helium nuclei from natural $$\alpha $$ radiation. But
if the energy of the incoming particles is large enough, new matter is sometimes
created in the collision. The more energy input or $$\Delta E $$ , the more
matter $$m $$ can be created, since $$m=\Delta E/{c}^{2} $$ . Limitations are
placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of
mass-energy, momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown
limitations provided by nature. Some expected reactions do occur, while others
do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed,
and the vast majority of what we know about particle physics has come from
accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist’s favorite indoor sport,
which is partly inspired by theory.

### Early Accelerators

An early accelerator is a relatively simple, large-scale version of the electron
gun. The **Van de Graaff** (named after the Dutch physicist), which you have
likely seen in physics demonstrations, is a small version of the ones used for
nuclear research since their invention for that purpose in 1932. For more,
see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). These machines are electrostatic, creating
potentials as great as 50 MV, and are used to accelerate a variety of nuclei for
a range of experiments. Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to
produce new particles, but they have been instrumental in exploring several
aspects of the nucleus. Another, equally famous, early accelerator is the **cyclotron**, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E. O. Lawrence (
1901–1958). For a visual representation with more detail,
see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric
fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic
field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever
arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy and so
greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff. Lawrence was
involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in
American universities. He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the
cyclotron and nuclear activations, and he has an element and two major
laboratories named for him.

A **synchrotron** is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the
alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam
particles are accelerated. Particles are made to travel the same distance in a
shorter time with each cycle in fixed-radius orbits. A ring of magnets and
accelerating tubes, as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3), are the major components
of synchrotrons. Accelerating voltages are synchronized (i.e., occur at the same
time) with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Magnetic field
strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases.
High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer them, so
superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable
magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high
energies, since the radius of a high-energy particle’s orbit is very large.
Radiation caused by a magnetic field accelerating a charged particle
perpendicular to its velocity is called **synchrotron radiation** in honor of
its importance in these machines. Synchrotron radiation has a characteristic
spectrum and polarization, and can be recognized in cosmic rays, implying
large-scale magnetic fields acting on energetic and charged particles in deep
space. Synchrotron radiation produced by accelerators is sometimes used as a
source of intense energetic electromagnetic radiation for research purposes.

Inside the tube a conveyer belt is seen running up and down the tube. On top of the tube is a metallic sphere maybe thirty centimeters in diameter.](../resources/Figure_33_03_01.jpg "An artist&#x2019;s rendition of a Van de Graaff generator.")

An alternating voltage is put across the gap, and an electric field is shown going from the left semicircular plate across the gap to the right semicircular plate. A magnetic field pierces the plates from top to bottom. A dotted line labeled external beam spirals outward from the center of the cyclotron, making four revolutions inside the semicircular plates before reaching the outer edge of the cyclotron.](../resources/Figure_33_03_02.jpg "Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the Ds, the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit.")

### Modern Behemoths and Colliding Beams

Physicists have built ever-larger machines, first to reduce the wavelength of
the probe and obtain greater detail, then to put greater energy into collisions
to create new particles. Each major energy increase brought new information,
sometimes producing spectacular progress, motivating the next step. One major
innovation was driven by the desire to create more massive particles. Since
momentum needs to be conserved in a collision, the particles created by a beam
hitting a stationary target should recoil. This means that part of the energy
input goes into recoil kinetic energy, significantly limiting the fraction of
the beam energy that can be converted into new particles. One solution to this
problem is to have head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite
directions. **Colliding beams** are made to meet head-on at points where massive
detectors are located. Since the total incoming momentum is zero, it is possible
to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. Particles with
masses equivalent to twice the beam energy can thus be created. Another
innovation is to create the antimatter counterpart of the beam particle, which
thus has the opposite charge and circulates in the opposite direction in the
same beam pipe. For a schematic representation, see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4).

![The first image shows a circular ring made up of about thirty blue tubes whose diameters are much less than the diameter of the ring. The tubes are arranged end-to-end, so that a line joining their axes forms the ring. The second image shows a close-up view of three consecutive tubes, which we shall call tubes one, two, and three. Tube one is labeled plus, tube two is labeled minus, and tube three is labeled plus. An arrow labeled E points from tube one to tube two, and between these two tubes is a sphere labeled p plus. The third image is the same as the second, except that the tubes one, two, and three are labeled minus, plus, minus, respectively. In addition, the arrow labeled E between tubes one and two has reversed direction, and a second arrow labeled E now appears pointing from tube two to tube three. Between tubes two and three appears the sphere labeled p plus.](../resources/Figure_33_03_04.jpg "(a) A synchrotron has a ring of magnets and accelerating tubes. The frequency of the accelerating voltages is increased to cause the beam particles to travel the same distance in shorter time. The magnetic field should also be increased to keep each beam burst traveling in a fixed-radius path. Limits on magnetic field strength require these machines to be very large in order to accelerate particles to very high energies. (b) A positive particle is shown in the gap between accelerating tubes. (c) While the particle passes through the tube, the potentials are reversed so that there is another acceleration at the next gap. The frequency of the reversals needs to be varied as the particle is accelerated to achieve successive accelerations in each gap.")

![On the left side of the image is a pair of equal-diameter, horizontal rings, with one labeled proton source and the other labeled anti proton source. The rings look like they are made of a hose; that is, their cross section is circular and they appear hollow. In the proton-source ring blue arrows appear indicating counterclockwise motion inside the hose. In the anti-proton-source ring, red arrows appear indicating clockwise motion inside the hose. A section of hose tangentially leaves each ring to tangentially join another larger ring to the right, which is labeled main ring. Both blue arrows and red arrows appear in the main ring, indicating simultaneous clockwise and counterclockwise motion. From the main ring two tangential hose sections exit to join a similar-sized ring situated beneath the main ring and that is labeled tevatron ring. In the tevatron ring, the blue arrows go half-way around clockwise and the red arrows go half-way around counterclockwise. They meet in a cube labeled collision detector and that has a yellow starburst icon on it.](../resources/Figure_33_03_05.jpg "This schematic shows the two rings of Fermilab&#x2019;s accelerator and the scheme for colliding protons and antiprotons (not to scale).       ")
{: #Figure4}

Detectors capable of finding the new particles in the spray of material that
emerges from colliding beams are as impressive as the accelerators. While the
Fermilab Tevatron had proton and antiproton beam energies of about 1 TeV, so
that it can create particles up to $$2 \text{TeV/}{c}^{2} $$ , the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) has achieved
beam energies of 3.5 TeV, so that it has a 7-TeV collision energy; CERN hopes to
double the beam energy in 2014. The now-canceled Superconducting Super Collider
was being constructed in Texas with a design energy of 20 TeV to give a 40-TeV
collision energy. It was to be an oval 30 km in diameter. Its cost as well as
the politics of international research funding led to its demise.

In addition to the large synchrotrons that produce colliding beams of protons
and antiprotons, there are other large electron-positron accelerators. The
oldest of these was a straight-line or **linear accelerator**, called the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which accelerated particles up to 50 GeV as
seen in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5). Positrons created by the accelerator were
brought to the same energy and collided with electrons in specially designed
detectors. Linear accelerators use accelerating tubes similar to those in
synchrotrons, but aligned in a straight line. This helps eliminate synchrotron
radiation losses, which are particularly severe for electrons made to follow
curved paths. CERN had an electron-positron collider appropriately called the
Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which accelerated particles to 100 GeV
and created a collision energy of 200 GeV. It was 8.5 km in diameter, while the
SLAC machine was 3.2 km long.

![The schematic shows a linear accelerator about three kilometers long with magnets along its path. Electrons and positrons coming from different sources are accelerated down the linear accelerator, then are deviated by magnets to the right and left, respectively, to follow paths that circle around to meet head-on at a large device labeled mark two particle detector.](../resources/Figure_33_03_06.jpg "The Stanford Linear Accelerator was 3.2 km long and had the capability of colliding electron and positron beams. SLAC was also used to probe nucleons by scattering extremely short wavelength electrons from them. This produced the first convincing evidence of a quark structure inside nucleons in an experiment analogous to those performed by Rutherford long ago.")

Calculating the Voltage Needed by the Accelerator Between Accelerating Tubes
</div>
A linear accelerator designed to produce a beam of 800-MeV protons has 2000 accelerating tubes. What average voltage must be applied between tubes (such as in the gaps in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)) to achieve the desired energy?

**Strategy**

The energy given to the proton in each gap between tubes is $${\text{PE}}_
{\text{elec}}=qV $$ where $$q $$ is the proton’s charge and $$V $$ is the
potential difference (voltage) across the gap. Since $$q={q}_{e}= 1.6 \times
10^{-19} \text{C} $$ and $$1 \text{eV}=\left(1 \text{V}\right)\left( 1.6 \times
10^{-19} \text{C}\right) $$ , the proton gains 1 eV in energy for each volt
across the gap that it passes through. The AC voltage applied to the tubes is
timed so that it adds to the energy in each gap. The effective voltage is the
sum of the gap voltages and equals 800 MV to give each proton an energy of 800
MeV.

**Solution**

There are 2000 gaps and the sum of the voltages across them is 800 MV; thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $${V}_{\text{gap}}=\frac{800 \text{MV}}{2000}=400 \text{kV}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

A voltage of this magnitude is not difficult to achieve in a vacuum. Much larger
gap voltages would be required for higher energy, such as those at the 50-GeV
SLAC facility. Synchrotrons are aided by the circular path of the accelerated
particles, which can orbit many times, effectively multiplying the number of
accelerations by the number of orbits. This makes it possible to reach energies
greater than 1 TeV.

### Summary

* A variety of particle accelerators have been used to explore the nature of
  subatomic particles and to test predictions of particle theories.
* Modern accelerators used in particle physics are either large synchrotrons or
  linear accelerators.
* The use of colliding beams makes much greater energy available for the
  creation of particles, and collisions between matter and antimatter allow a
  greater range of final products.

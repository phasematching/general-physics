We can represent electric potentials (voltages) pictorially, just as we drew
pictures to illustrate electric fields. Of course, the two are related.
Consider [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), which shows an isolated positive point charge
and its electric field lines. Electric field lines radiate out from a positive
charge and terminate on negative charges. While we use blue arrows to represent
the magnitude and direction of the electric field, we use green lines to
represent places where the electric potential is constant. These are called **
equipotential lines** in two dimensions, or *equipotential surfaces* in three
dimensions. The term *equipotential* is also used as a noun, referring to an
equipotential line or surface. The potential for a point charge is the same
anywhere on an imaginary sphere of radius $$r $$ surrounding the charge. This is
true since the potential for a point charge is given by $$V=kQ/r $$ and, thus,
has the same value at any point that is a given distance $$r $$ from the charge.
An equipotential sphere is a circle in the two-dimensional view
of [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Since the electric field lines point radially away
from the charge, they are perpendicular to the equipotential lines.

![The figure shows a positive charge Q at the center of four concentric circles of increasing radii. The electric potential is the same along each of the circles, called equipotential lines. Straight lines representing electric field lines are drawn from the positive charge to intersect the circles at various points. The equipotential lines are perpendicular to the electric field lines.](../resources/Figure_20_04_01a.jpg "An isolated point charge \( Q \) with its electric field lines in blue and equipotential lines in green. The potential is the same along each equipotential line, meaning that no work is required to move a charge anywhere along one of those lines. Work is needed to move a charge from one equipotential line to another. Equipotential lines are perpendicular to electric field lines in every case. ")
{: #Figure1}

It is important to note that **equipotential lines are always perpendicular to
electric field lines** . No work is required to move a charge along an
equipotential, since $$\Delta V=0 $$ . Thus the work is

<div class="equation" >
 $$W= -\Delta \text{PE}= -q\Delta V=0. $$
</div>

Work is zero if force is perpendicular to motion. Force is in the same direction
as $$\mathbf{\text{E}} $$ , so that motion along an equipotential must be
perpendicular to $$\mathbf{\text{E}} $$ . More precisely, work is related to the
electric field by

<div class="equation" >
 $$W=Fd \cos \theta =qEd \cos \theta =0. $$
</div>

Note that in the above equation, $$E $$ and $$F $$ symbolize the magnitudes of
the electric field strength and force, respectively. Neither $$q $$ nor
$$\mathbf{\text{E}} $$ nor $$d $$ is zero, and so $$\cos \theta $$ must be 0,
meaning $$\theta $$ must be $$90 \text{º} $$ . In other words, motion along an
equipotential is perpendicular to $$\mathbf{\text{E}} $$.

One of the rules for static electric fields and conductors is that the electric
field must be perpendicular to the surface of any conductor. This implies that
a **conductor is an equipotential surface in static situations** . There can be
no voltage difference across the surface of a conductor, or charges will flow.
One of the uses of this fact is that a conductor can be fixed at zero volts by
connecting it to the earth with a good conductor—a process called **grounding**.
Grounding can be a useful safety tool. For example, grounding the metal case of
an electrical appliance ensures that it is at zero volts relative to the earth.

Grounding
</div>
A conductor can be fixed at zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor—a process called grounding.

</div>

Because a conductor is an equipotential, it can replace any equipotential
surface. For example, in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) a charged spherical conductor
can replace the point charge, and the electric field and potential surfaces
outside of it will be unchanged, confirming the contention that a spherical
charge distribution is equivalent to a point charge at its center.

[[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows the electric field and equipotential lines for two
equal and opposite charges. Given the electric field lines, the equipotential
lines can be drawn simply by making them perpendicular to the electric field
lines. Conversely, given the equipotential lines, as in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(
a), the electric field lines can be drawn by making them perpendicular to the
equipotentials, as in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)(b).

![The figure shows two sets of concentric circles, called equipotential lines, drawn with positive and negative charges at their centers. Curved electric field lines emanate from the positive charge and curve to meet the negative charge. The lines form closed curves between the charges. The equipotential lines are always perpendicular to the field lines.](../resources/Figure_20_04_02a.jpg "The electric field lines and equipotential lines for two equal but opposite charges. The equipotential lines can be drawn by making them perpendicular to the electric field lines, if those are known. Note that the potential is greatest (most positive) near the positive charge and least (most negative) near the negative charge. ")
{: #Figure2}

![Figure (a) shows two circles, called equipotential lines, along which the potential is negative ten volts. A dumbbell-shaped surface encloses the two circles and is labeled negative five volts. This surface is surrounded by another surface labeled negative two volts. Figure (b) shows the same equipotential lines, each set with a negative charge at its center. Blue electric field lines curve toward the negative charges from all directions.](../resources/Figure_20_04_03a.jpg "(a) These equipotential lines might be measured with a voltmeter in a laboratory experiment. (b) The corresponding electric field lines are found by drawing them perpendicular to the equipotentials. Note that these fields are consistent with two equal negative charges. ")
{: #Figure3}

One of the most important cases is that of the familiar parallel conducting
plates shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). Between the plates, the equipotentials
are evenly spaced and parallel. The same field could be maintained by placing
conducting plates at the equipotential lines at the potentials shown.

![The figure shows two parallel plates A and B separated by a distance d. Plate A is positively charged, and B is negatively charged. Electric field lines are parallel to one another between the plates and curved near the ends of the plates. The voltages range from a hundred volts at Plate A to zero volts at plate B.](../resources/Figure_20_04_04a.jpg "The electric field and equipotential lines between two metal plates.")
{: #Figure4}

An important application of electric fields and equipotential lines involves the
heart. The heart relies on electrical signals to maintain its rhythm. The
movement of electrical signals causes the chambers of the heart to contract and
relax. When a person has a heart attack, the movement of these electrical
signals may be disturbed. An artificial pacemaker and a defibrillator can be
used to initiate the rhythm of electrical signals. The equipotential lines
around the heart, the thoracic region, and the axis of the heart are useful ways
of monitoring the structure and functions of the heart. An electrocardiogram (
ECG) measures the small electric signals being generated during the activity of
the heart. More about the relationship between electric fields and the heart is
discussed in [Energy Stored in Capacitors](/ch19EnergyStoredInCapacitors).

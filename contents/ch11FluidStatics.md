Much of what we value in life is fluid: a breath of fresh winter air; the hot
blue flame in our gas cooker; the water we drink, swim in, and bathe in; the
blood in our veins. What exactly is a fluid? Can we understand fluids with the
laws already presented, or will new laws emerge from their study? The physical
characteristics of static or stationary fluids and some laws that govern their
behavior are the topics of this
chapter. [Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications](/ch12FluidDynamicsAndItsBiologicalApplications)
explores aspects of fluid flow.

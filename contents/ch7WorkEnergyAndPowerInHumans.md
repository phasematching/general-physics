### Energy Conversion in Humans

Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines.
Conservation of energy implies that the chemical energy stored in food is
converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty
tissue. (See [Figure 1](#Figure1).) The fraction going into each form depends both
on how much we eat and on our level of physical activity. If we eat more than is
needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat.

![A schematic diagram of energy consumed by humans and converted to various other forms is shown. Food energy is converted into work, thermal energy, and stored fat depicted by an arrow branching out of food energy and ending at these three forms. Stored fat plus thermal energy is equal to the final other energy, labeled  O E sub f, and nonconservative work is shown by W sub n c, which is negative, so the initial other energy, labeled O E sub i, plus W sub n c is equal to O E sub f .](../resources/Figure_07_08_01.jpg "Energy consumed by humans is converted to work, thermal energy, and stored fat. By far the largest fraction goes to thermal energy, although the fraction varies depending on the type of physical activity.")
{: #Figure1}

### Power Consumed at Rest

The *rate* at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do
different activities is called the **metabolic rate**. The total energy
conversion rate of a person *at rest*
is called the **basal metabolic rate** (BMR) and is divided among various
systems in the body, as shown in [Table 1](#Table1). The largest fraction goes
to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous
exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase
markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic
functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount
of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a
greater BMR due to this last factor.

##### Table 1: Basal Metabolic Rates (BMR) for a 76-kg person.

|Organ|Power consumed at rest (W)|Oxygen consumption (mL/min)|Percent of BMR|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Liver & spleen|23|67|27|
|Brain|16|47|19|
|Skeletal muscle|15|45|18|
|Kidney|9|26|10|
|Heart|6|17|7|
|Other|16|48|19|
|Totals|85 W|250 mL/min|100%|

{: #Table1}

Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the
digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy
people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use. (
See [Figure 2](#Figure2).) Approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each
liter of oxygen consumed, independent of the type of food. [Table 1](#Table1)
shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of
activities.

### Power of Doing Useful Work

Work done by a person is sometimes called **useful work**, which is *work done
on the outside world*, such as lifting weights. Useful work requires a force
exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal
work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does
include that done in climbing stairs or accelerating to a full run, because
these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted
by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy (
$$ \KE+\PE $$ )
of the system worked upon, and this is often the goal. A baseball player
throwing a ball, for example, increases both the ball’s kinetic and potential
energy.

If a person needs more energy than they consume, such as when doing vigorous
work, the body must draw upon the chemical energy stored in fat. So exercise can
be helpful in losing fat. However, the amount of exercise needed to produce a
loss in fat, or to burn off extra calories consumed that day, can be large,
as [Example 1](#example1) illustrates.

<div class="example" id="example1" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Weight Loss from Exercising
</div>
If a person who normally requires an average of 12 000 kJ (3000 kcal) of food energy per day consumes 13 000 kJ per day, he will steadily gain weight. How much bicycling per day is required to work off this extra 1000 kJ?

**Solution**

[Table 2](#Table2) states that 400 W are used when cycling at a moderate speed.
The time required to work off 1000 kJ at this rate is then

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Time}=\frac{ \text{energy}}{\left(\frac{ \text{energy}}{\text{time}}\right)}=\frac{1000 \text{kJ}}{400 \text{W}}=2500 \s  =42 \text{min.} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

If this person uses more energy than they consume, the person’s body will obtain
the needed energy by metabolizing body fat. If the person uses 13 000 kJ but
consumes only 12 000 kJ, then the amount of fat loss will be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{Fat loss}=\left(1000 \text{kJ}\right)\left(\frac{1.0 \text{g fat}}{39 \text{kJ}}\right)=26\text{g,} $$
</div>
assuming the energy content of fat to be 39 kJ/g.

{: #Table2}

All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (
See [Figure 3](#Figure3).) The many small muscle actions accompanying all quiet
activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as
do less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract.
Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to low body temperature that pits
muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no
work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the
biggest surprise of all is that a full 25% of all energy consumed by the body is
used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use
this electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy
ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but some is utilized to power chemical
processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.

### Section Summary

* The human body converts energy stored in food into work, thermal energy,
  and/or chemical energy that is stored in fatty tissue.
* The *rate* at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do
  different activities is called the metabolic rate, and the corresponding rate
  when at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (  BMR)
* The energy included in the basal metabolic rate is divided among various
  systems in the body, with the largest fraction going to the liver and spleen,
  and the brain coming next.
* About 75% of food calories are used to sustain basic body functions included
  in the basal metabolic rate.
* The energy consumption of people during various activities can be determined
  by measuring their oxygen use, because the digestive process is basically one
  of oxidizing food.

The awe-inspiring Great Pyramid of Cheops was built more than 4500 years ago. Its square base, originally 230 m on a side, covered 13.1 acres, and it was 146 m high, with a mass of about $$ 7\times 10^{9}\kg $$. (The pyramid’s dimensions are slightly different today due to quarrying and

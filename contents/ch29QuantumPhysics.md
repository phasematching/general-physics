Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics needed to deal with submicroscopic
objects. Because these objects are smaller than we can observe directly with our
senses and generally must be observed with the aid of instruments, parts of
quantum mechanics seem as foreign and bizarre as parts of relativity. But, like
relativity, quantum mechanics has been shown to be valid—truth is often stranger
than fiction.

Certain aspects of quantum mechanics are familiar to us. We accept as fact that
matter is composed of atoms, the smallest unit of an element, and that these
atoms combine to form molecules, the smallest unit of a compound. (
See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) While we cannot see the individual water molecules
in a stream, for example, we are aware that this is because molecules are so
small and so numerous in that stream. When introducing atoms, we commonly say
that electrons orbit atoms in discrete shells around a tiny nucleus, itself
composed of smaller particles called protons and neutrons. We are also aware
that electric charge comes in tiny units carried almost entirely by electrons
and protons. As with water molecules in a stream, we do not notice individual
charges in the current through a lightbulb, because the charges are so small and
so numerous in the macroscopic situations we sense directly.

A magnified view of the nucleus is shown as a bunch of small spherical balls.](../resources/Figure_29_00_02.jpg "Atoms and their substructure are familiar examples of objects that require quantum mechanics to be fully explained. Certain of their characteristics, such as the discrete electron shells, are classical physics explanations. In quantum mechanics we conceptualize discrete &#x201C;electron clouds&#x201D; around the nucleus. ")

Making Connections: Realms of Physics

Classical physics is a good approximation of modern physics under conditions first discussed
in the [The Nature of Science and Physics](../contents/ch1IntroductionTheNatureOfScienceAndPhysics). Quantum mechanics is valid in general, and it must be used rather than classical physics to describe small objects, such as atoms.

Atoms, molecules, and fundamental electron and proton charges are all examples
of physical entities that are **quantized**—that is, they appear only in certain
discrete values and do not have every conceivable value. Quantized is the
opposite of continuous. We cannot have a fraction of an atom, or part of an
electron’s charge, or 14-1/3 cents, for example. Rather, everything is built of
integral multiples of these substructures. Quantum physics is the branch of
physics that deals with small objects and the quantization of various entities,
including energy and angular momentum. Just as with classical physics, quantum
physics has several subfields, such as mechanics and the study of
electromagnetic forces. The **correspondence principle** states that in the
classical limit (large, slow-moving objects), **quantum mechanics** becomes the
same as classical physics. In this chapter, we begin the development of quantum
mechanics and its description of the strange submicroscopic world. In later
chapters, we will examine many areas, such as atomic and nuclear physics, in
which quantum mechanics is crucial.

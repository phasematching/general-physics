### Work Done Against Gravity

Climbing stairs and lifting objects is work in both the scientific and everyday
sense—it is work done against the gravitational force. When there is work, there
is a transformation of energy. The work done against the gravitational force
goes into an important form of stored energy that we will explore in this
section.

Let us calculate the work done in lifting an object of mass $$ m $$
through a height $$ h $$, such as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1697782). If the object is lifted
straight up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its
weight $$ mg  $$. The work done on the mass is then $$ \text{W = Fd = mgh} $$. We define this to be the **gravitational potential energy**{: data-type="term"
} $$ \left({\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}\right) $$
put into (or gained by) the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with
the state of separation between two objects that attract each other by the
gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the $$ {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}} $$
gained by the object, recognizing that this is energy stored in the
gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word “system”? Potential energy
is a property of a system rather than of a single object—due to its physical
position. An object’s gravitational potential is due to its position relative to
the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object
is an external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it
increases the gravitational potential energy of the system. Because
gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference
level at which to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this
point to be Earth’s surface, but this point is arbitrary; what is important is
the *difference* in gravitational potential energy, because this difference is
what relates to the work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy
of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two rungs of a ladder will be
the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs.

### Converting Between Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy

Gravitational potential energy may be converted to other forms of energy, such
as kinetic energy. If we release the mass, gravitational force will do an amount
of work equal to $$ mgh  $$
on it, thereby increasing its kinetic energy by that same amount (by the
work-energy theorem). We will find it more useful to consider just the
conversion of $$ {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}} $$
to $$ \text{KE} $$
without explicitly considering the intermediate step of work. (
See [\[link\]](#fs-id2895434).) This shortcut makes it is easier to solve
problems using energy (if possible) rather than explicitly using forces.

![(a) The weight attached to the cuckoo clock is raised by a height h shown by a displacement vector d pointing upward. The weight is attached to a winding chain labeled with a force F vector pointing downward. Vector d is also shown in the same direction as force F. E in is equal to W and W is equal to m g h. (b) The weight attached to the cuckoo clock moves downward. E out is equal to m g h.](../resources/Figure_08_03_01a.jpg "(a) The work done to lift the weight is stored in the mass-Earth system as gravitational potential energy. (b) As the weight moves downward, this gravitational potential energy is transferred to the cuckoo clock.")
{: #import-auto-id1697782}

More precisely, we define the *change* in gravitational potential energy $$
\Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}} $$
to be

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-306">
 $$ \Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}=mgh , $$ 
</div>

where, for simplicity, we denote the change in height by $$ h $$
rather than the usual $$ \Delta h $$. Note that $$ h $$
is positive when the final height is greater than the initial height, and vice
versa. For example, if a 0.500-kg mass hung from a cuckoo clock is raised 1.00
m, then its change in gravitational potential energy is

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}mgh & =& \left(0.500 \text{kg}\right)\left( 9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\right)\left(1.00 \text{m}\right)\\ & =& 4.90 \text{kg}\cdot {m}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}\text{= 4.90 J.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>

Note that the units of gravitational potential energy turn out to be joules, the
same as for work and other forms of energy. As the clock runs, the mass is
lowered. We can think of the mass as gradually giving up its 4.90 J of
gravitational potential energy, *without directly considering the force of
gravity that does the work*.

### Using Potential Energy to Simplify Calculations

The equation $$ \Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}=mgh  $$
applies for any path that has a change in height of $$ h $$, not just when the mass is lifted straight up. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1556510).) It is much easier to calculate $$
mgh  $$
(a simple multiplication) than it is to calculate the work done along a
complicated path. The idea of gravitational potential energy has the double
advantage that it is very broadly applicable and it makes calculations easier.
From now on, we will consider that any change in vertical position $$ h $$
of a mass $$ m $$
is accompanied by a change in gravitational potential energy $$ mgh  $$, and we will avoid the equivalent but more difficult task of calculating work
done by or against the gravitational force.

![There is a four-story building. A person is carrying a television up the stairs of the building. The height of third story is h from the ground. A girl is standing outside the building and is lifting a similar television with the help of a pulley.](../resources/Figure_08_03_02a.jpg "The change in gravitational potential energy (&#x394;PEg) size 12{ \( &#x394;&quot;PE&quot; rSub { size 8{g} } \) } {} between points A and B is independent of the path. &#x394;PEg=mgh size 12{&#x394;&quot;PE&quot; rSub { size 8{g} } = ital &quot;mgh&quot;} {} for any path between the two points. Gravity is one of a small class of forces where the work done by or against the force depends only on the starting and ending points, not on the path between them.")

The Force to Stop Falling
</div>
A 60.0-kg person jumps onto the floor from a height of 3.00 m. If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints compressing by 0.500 cm), calculate the force on the knee joints.

**Strategy**

This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on
him by the floor as he stops. The initial $$ {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}} $$
is transformed into $$ \text{KE} $$
as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic energy to zero.

**Solution**

The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-955">
 $$ W=F d \cos{\theta} =-F d , $$ 
</div>
with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions  $$ \left(\cos{\theta} =\cos{ 180^\circ }=-1\right) $$ . The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work.

The kinetic energy the person has upon reaching the floor is the amount of
potential energy lost by falling through height $$ h $$
\:

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \text{KE}=-\Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}=-mgh , $$ 
</div>
The distance  $$ d $$ 

that the person’s knees bend is much smaller than the height $$ h $$
of the fall, so the additional change in gravitational potential energy during
the knee bend is ignored.

The work $$ W $$
done by the floor on the person stops the person and brings the person’s kinetic
energy to zero:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-418">
 $$ W=-\text{KE}=mgh . $$ 
</div>
Combining this equation with the expression for  $$ W $$ 

gives

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ -F d =mgh . $$ 
</div>
Recalling that  $$ h $$ 

is negative because the person fell *down*, the force on the knee joints is
given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-118">
 $$ F=-\frac{mgh }{d}=-\frac{\left(60.0 \text{kg}\right)\left(9.80 \text{ m}{\text{/s}}^{2}\right)\left(-3.00 \text{m}\right)}{5.00\times 10^{-3}\text{m}}=3.53\times 10^{5}N. $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

Such a large force (500 times more than the person’s weight) over the short
impact time is enough to break bones. A much better way to cushion the shock is
by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the
force acts. A bending motion of 0.5 m this way yields a force 100 times smaller
than in the example. A kangaroo\'s hopping shows this method in action. The
kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for locomotion, but the shock
in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(
See [\[link\]](#fs-id1503032).)

</div>

![A hopping kangaroo is shown landing on the ground in one photograph and in the air just after taking another jump in the second photograph.](../resources/Figure_08_03_03.jpg "The work done by the ground upon the kangaroo reduces its kinetic energy to zero as it lands. However, by applying the force of the ground on the hind legs over a longer distance, the impact on the bones is reduced. (credit: Chris Samuel, Flickr)")

Finding the Speed of a Roller Coaster from its Height
</div>
(a) What is the final speed of the roller coaster shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1349448) if it starts from rest at the top of the 20.0 m hill and work done by frictional forces is negligible? (b) What is its final speed (again assuming negligible friction) if its initial speed is 5.00 m/s?

![A roller coaster track is shown with a car about to go downhill. The initial height of the roller coaster car on the track is twenty-five meters from the lowest part of the track and its speed v sub zero is equal to zero. The roller coaster&#x2019;s height from the level part of the track is twenty meters. The finish point of the car is on the level part of the track and the speed at that point is unknown.](../resources/Figure_08_03_04a.jpg "The speed of a roller coaster increases as gravity pulls it downhill and is greatest at its lowest point. Viewed in terms of energy, the roller-coaster-Earth system&#x2019;s gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If work done by friction is negligible, all &#x394;PEg size 12{&#x394;&quot;PE&quot; rSub { size 8{g} } } {} is converted to KE size 12{&quot;KE&quot;} {}.")
{: #import-auto-id1349448 height="200"}

**Strategy**

The roller coaster loses potential energy as it goes downhill. We neglect
friction, so that the remaining force exerted by the track is the normal force,
which is perpendicular to the direction of motion and does no work. The net work
on the roller coaster is then done by gravity alone. The *loss* of gravitational
potential energy from moving *downward*
through a distance $$ h $$
equals the *gain* in kinetic energy. This can be written in equation form as $$
-\Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}=\Delta \text{KE} $$. Using the equations for $$ {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}} $$
and $$ \text{KE} $$, we can solve for the final speed $$ v $$, which is the desired quantity.

**Solution for (a)**

Here the initial kinetic energy is zero, so that $$
\text{ΔKE}=\frac{1}{2}m v^{2} $$. The equation for change in potential energy states that $$ {\text{ΔPE}}_{\text{g}}=mgh  $$. Since $$ h $$
is negative in this case, we will rewrite this as $$ {\text{ΔPE}}_{\text{g}}=-mg \mid h\mid $$
to show the minus sign clearly. Thus,

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ -\Delta {\text{PE}}_{\text{g}}=\Delta \text{KE} $$ 
</div>
becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-579">
 $$ mg \mid h\mid =\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
Solving for  $$ v $$ 

, we find that mass cancels and that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-895">
 $$ v=\sqrt{2g\mid h\mid }. $$ 
</div>
Substituting known values,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-230">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}v& =& \sqrt{2\left(9.80 \text{m/s}^{2}\right)\left(20.0 \text{m}\right)}\\ & =&19 \text{.8 m/s.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

Again $$ -{\text{ΔPE}}_{\text{g}}=\text{ΔKE} $$. In this case there is initial kinetic energy, so $$
\text{ΔKE}=\frac{1}{2}m{v}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m{ v_{0}}^{2} $$. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-90">
 $$ mg \mid h\mid =\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m{ v_{0}}^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
Rearranging gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-484">
 $$ \frac{1}{2}m v^{2}=mg \mid h\mid +\frac{1}{2}m{ v_{0}}^{2}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
This means that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy. Mass again cancels, and

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-436">
 $$ v=\sqrt{2g\mid h\mid +{ v_{0}}^{2}}. $$ 
</div>
This equation is very similar to the kinematics equation  $$ v=\sqrt{ { v_{0}}^{2}+2ad} $$ 

, but it is more general—the kinematics equation is valid only for constant
acceleration, whereas our equation above is valid for any path regardless of
whether the object moves with a constant acceleration. Now, substituting known
values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-388">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}v& =& \sqrt{2\left(9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\right)\left(20}.0 \text{m}\right)+\left(5.00 \text{m/s}{\right)}^{2}}\\ & =& \text{20.4 m/s.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
**Discussion and Implications**

First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made
in [Falling Objects](/contents/m42102)
that all objects fall at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only
the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no information about its
direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is
negligible, the speed of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and
height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the roller coaster
will have the same final speed whether it falls 20.0 m straight down or takes a
more complicated path like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps
unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but by
far less than 5.00 m/s. Finally, note that speed can be found at *any* height
along the way by simply using the appropriate value of $$ h $$
at the point of interest.

</div>

We have seen that work done by or against the gravitational force depends only
on the starting and ending points, and not on the path between, allowing us to
define the simplifying concept of gravitational potential energy. We can do the
same thing for a few other forces, and we will see that this leads to a formal
definition of the law of conservation of energy.

Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy
</div>
One can study the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy in this experiment. On a smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an incline (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1965985)). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll 1 m on the level surface. Find the velocity of the marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble’s kinetic energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point.

In [[link]](#fs-id2895434), we calculated the final speed of a roller coaster that descended 20 m in height and had an initial speed of 5 m/s downhill.

We would find in that case that its final speed is the same as its initial speed. Explain in terms of conservation of energy.

Particle physics as we know it today began with the ideas of Hideki Yukawa in 1935. Physicists had long been concerned with how forces are transmitted,
      finding the concept of fields, such as electric and magnetic fields to be
      very useful. A field surrounds an object and carries the force exerted by
      the object through space. Yukawa was interested in the strong nuclear
      force in particular and found an ingenious way to explain its short range.
      His idea is a blend of particles, forces, relativity, and quantum
      mechanics that is applicable to all forces. Yukawa proposed that force is
      transmitted by the exchange of particles (
      called carrier particles). The field consists of these carrier particles.

After the exchange, the proton has become a neutron and the neutron has become a proton.](../resources/Figure_33_01_01.jpg "The strong nuclear force is transmitted between a proton and neutron by the creation and exchange of a pion. The pion is created through a temporary violation of conservation of mass-energy and travels from the proton to the neutron and is recaptured. It is not directly observable and is called a virtual particle. Note that the proton and neutron change identity in the process. The range of the force is limited by the fact that the pion can only exist for the short time allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Yukawa used the finite range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle.")
{ #Figure1}

Specifically for the strong nuclear force, Yukawa proposed that a previously
unknown particle, now called a **pion**, is exchanged between nucleons,
transmitting the force between them. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) illustrates how a
pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron. The pion has mass and
can only be created by violating the conservation of mass-energy. This is
allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle if it occurs for a sufficiently
short period of time. As discussed
in [Probability: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle](../contents/ch29Probability) the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle relates the uncertainties $$\Delta E $$ in energy and
$$\Delta t $$ in time by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta E\Delta t\ge \frac{h}{4\pi }\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$h $$ is Planck’s constant. Therefore, conservation of mass-energy can be
violated by an amount $$\Delta E $$ for a time $$\Delta t\approx \frac{h}{4\pi
\Delta E} $$ in which time no process can detect the violation. This allows the
temporary creation of a particle of mass $$m $$ , where $$\Delta E=mc^{2} $$ .
The larger the mass and the greater the $$\Delta E $$ , the shorter is the time
it can exist. This means the range of the force is limited, because the particle
can only travel a limited distance in a finite amount of time. In fact, the
maximum distance is $$d\approx c\Delta t $$ , where *c* is the speed of light.
The pion must then be captured and, thus, cannot be directly observed because
that would amount to a permanent violation of mass-energy conservation. Such
particles (like the pion above) are called **virtual particles**, because they
cannot be directly observed but their *effects* can be directly observed.
Realizing all this, Yukawa used the information on the range of the strong
nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion, the particle that carries it.
The steps of his reasoning are approximately retraced in the following worked
example:

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating the Mass of a Pion
</div>
Taking the range of the strong nuclear force to be about 1 fermi ( $$ 10^{-15} \text{m} $$ ), 
calculate the approximate mass of the pion carrying the force, assuming it moves at nearly the speed of light.

**Strategy**

The calculation is approximate because of the assumptions made about the range
of the force and the speed of the pion, but also because a more accurate
calculation would require the sophisticated mathematics of quantum mechanics.
Here, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the simple form stated
above, as developed
in [Probability: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle](../contents/ch29Probability). First, we must
calculate the time $$\Delta t $$ that the pion exists, given that the distance
it travels at nearly the speed of light is about 1 fermi. Then, the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle can be solved for the energy $$\Delta E $$ , and from that
the mass of the pion can be determined. We will use the units of
$$\text{MeV}/{c}^{2} $$ for mass, which are convenient since we are often
considering converting mass to energy and vice versa.

**Solution**

The distance the pion travels is $$d\approx c\Delta t $$ , and so the time
during which it exists is approximately

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta t& \approx & \frac{d}{c}=\frac{  10^{-15} \text{m}}{ 3.0 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}}\\ & \approx &  3.3 \times 10^{-24}  \text{s} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
Now, solving the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for  $$\Delta E $$
 gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta E\approx \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta t}\approx \frac{ 6.63 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J}\cdot \text{s}}{4\pi \left( 3.3 \times 10^{-24}  \text{s}\right)}\text{.} $$
</div>
Solving this and converting the energy to MeV gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta E\approx \left( 1.6 \times 10^{-11}  \text{J}\right)\frac{1 \text{MeV}}{ 1.6 \times 10^{-13}  \text{J}}=100 \text{MeV}\text{.} $$
</div>
Mass is related to energy by  $$\Delta E=mc^{2} $$ ,
 so that the mass of the pion is  $$m=\Delta E/{c}^{2} $$, or 

<div class="equation" >
 $$m\approx 100 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is about 200 times the mass of an electron and about one-tenth the mass of
a nucleon. No such particles were known at the time Yukawa made his bold
proposal.

</div>

Yukawa’s proposal of particle exchange as the method of force transfer is
intriguing. But how can we verify his proposal if we cannot observe the virtual
pion directly? If sufficient energy is in a nucleus, it would be possible to
free the pion—that is, to create its mass from external energy input. This can
be accomplished by collisions of energetic particles with nuclei, but energies
greater than 100 MeV are required to conserve both energy and momentum. In 1947,
pions were observed in cosmic-ray experiments, which were designed to supply a
small flux of high-energy protons that may collide with nuclei. Soon afterward,
accelerators of sufficient energy were creating pions in the laboratory under
controlled conditions. Three pions were discovered, two with charge and one
neutral, and given the symbols $${\pi }^{+}\text{,} {\pi }^{-}\text{, and} {\pi
}^{0} $$ , respectively. The masses of $${\pi }^{+} $$ and $${\pi }^{-} $$ are
identical at $$ 139.6 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ , whereas $${\pi }^{0} $$ has a mass
of $$ 135.0 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ . These masses are close to the predicted
value of $$100 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ and, since they are intermediate between
electron and nucleon masses, the particles are given the name **meson** (now an
entire class of particles, as we shall see
in [Particles, Patterns, and Conservation Laws](../contents/ch33ParticlesPatternsAndConservationLaws)).

The pions, or $$\pi $$ -mesons as they are also called, have masses close to
those predicted and feel the strong nuclear force. Another previously unknown
particle, now called the muon, was discovered during cosmic-ray experiments in
1936 (one of its discoverers, Seth Neddermeyer, also originated the idea of
implosion for plutonium bombs). Since the mass of a muon is around $$106
\text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ , at first it was thought to be the particle predicted by
Yukawa. But it was soon realized that muons do not feel the strong nuclear force
and could not be Yukawa’s particle. Their role was unknown, causing the
respected physicist I. I. Rabi to comment, “Who ordered that?” This remains a
valid question today. We have discovered hundreds of subatomic particles; the
roles of some are only partially understood. But there are various patterns and
relations to forces that have led to profound insights into nature’s secrets.

### Summary

* Yukawa’s idea of virtual particle exchange as the carrier of forces is
  crucial, with virtual particles being formed in temporary violation of the
  conservation of mass-energy as allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty
  principle.

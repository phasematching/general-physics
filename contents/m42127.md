### Vectors in Two Dimensions

A **vector**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296389850} is a quantity that
has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force,
for example, are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the
direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two
dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some
reference frame (i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length
proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction of the
vector.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298666909) shows such a *graphical representation
of a vector*, using as an example the total displacement for the person walking
in a city considered
in [Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction](/contents/m42104). We shall
use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as $$ \vb{D} $$, stands 
for a 
vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol, $$\mag{D}$$, and its 
direction by $$ \theta $$. The magnitude can also represented in italics as $$ 
D $$ when the context is clear. We will used this shorthand notation ftom 
time to time in this textbook.

Vectors in this Text
</div>
In this text, we will represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example,
we will represent the quantity force with the vector  $$ \text{F} $$,
which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector will be
represented by a variable in italics, such as $$ F $$, and the direction of the
variable will be given by an angle $$ \theta $$.

### Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method

The **head-to-tail method**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298552505} is
a graphical way to add vectors, described
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298643218) below and in the steps following.
The **tail**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298535408} of the vector is
the starting point of the vector, and the **head**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id1165298982372} (or tip) of a vector is the final, pointed end of
the arrow.

Then a vertical arrow from the head of the horizontal arrow is drawn.

The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the precision
with which the drawings can be made and the precision of the measuring tools. It
is valid for any number of vectors.

<div data-type="title">
Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk
</div>
Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement 
of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field.
First, she walks 25.0 m in a direction  $$ 49.0^\circ $$ 
north of east. Then, she walks 23.0 m heading $$ 15.0^\circ $$ north of east.
Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a direction 68.0° south of east.

**Strategy**

Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first
$$ \text{A} $$, the second $$ \text{B} $$, and the third $$ \text{C} $$, making
the lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified
relative to an east-west line. The head-to-tail method outlined above will give
a way to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement,
denoted $$ \vb{R} $$.

**Solution**

(1) Draw the three displacement vectors.

![On the graph a vector of magnitude twenty three meters and inclined above the x axis at an angle theta-b equal to fifteen degrees is shown. This vector is labeled as B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_08.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165296232338}

(2) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial magnitude and
direction.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis.](../resources/Figure_03_02_09.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165298788198}

(3) Draw the resultant vector, $$ \text{R} $$.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_10.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165298786300}

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of $$ \vb{R} $$, and a
protractor to measure the direction of $$ \text{R} $$. While the direction of
the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the
angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the
resultant vector is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the protractor
upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector.

![In this figure a vector A with a positive slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector A another vector B with positive slope is drawn and then another vector C with negative slope from the head of the vector B is drawn which cuts the x axis. From the tail of the vector A a vector R of magnitude of fifty meter and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector C. The vector R is known as the resultant vector. A ruler is placed along the vector R to measure it. Also there is a protractor to measure the angle.](../resources/Figure_03_02_11a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165298931707}

In this case, the total displacement $$ \vb{R} $$ is seen to have a
magnitude of 50.0 m and to lie in a direction $$ 7.0^\circ $$ south of east. By
using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as $$ R=50.0
\text{m} $$ and $$ \theta =7.0^\circ $$ south of east.

**Discussion**

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of
vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is independent of the
order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in any
order as illustrated in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298931858) and we will
still get the same solution.

![In this figure a vector C with a negative slope is drawn from the origin. Then from the head of the vector C another vector A with positive slope is drawn and then another vector B with negative slope from the head of the vector A is drawn. From the tail of the vector C a vector R of magnitude of fifty point zero meters and with negative slope of seven degrees is drawn. The head of this vector R meets the head of the vector B. The vector R is known as the resultant vector.](../resources/Figure_03_02_12.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165298931858}

Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the
result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is an
important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is **commutative**{:
data-type="term"}. Vectors can be added in any order.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-376">
 $$ \vb{A}+\vb{B}=\vb{B}+\vb{A}. $$ 
</div>
(This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well—you get the same result
whether you add  $$ \mathbf{2}+\mathbf{3} $$ 
or $$ \mathbf{3}+\mathbf{2} $$, for example).

</div>

### Vector Subtraction

Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To define
subtraction (say we want to subtract $$ \vb{B} $$ from $$
\vb{A} $$, written $$ \vb{A}–\vb{B} $$, we must
first define what we mean by subtraction. The *negative* of a vector $$
\vb{B} $$ is defined to be $$ \mathbf{\text{–B}} $$ ; that is,
graphically *the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite
direction*, as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298692950). In other
words, $$ \vb{B} $$ has the same length as $$ \mathbf{\text{–B}} $$,
but points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just flip the vector so it
points in the opposite direction.

![Two vectors are shown. One of the vectors is labeled as vector   in north east direction. The other vector is of the same magnitude and is in the opposite direction to that of vector B. This vector is denoted as negative B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_13a.jpg "The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction. So  \( B \)  is the negative of &#x2013;B size 12{ ital &quot;-B&quot;} {}; it has the same length but opposite direction.      ")
{: #import-auto-id1165298692950 height="200"}

The **subtraction** of vector $$ \vb{B} $$ from vector $$
\vb{A} $$ is then simply defined to be the addition of $$
\mathbf{\text{–B}} $$ to $$ \vb{A} $$. Note that vector subtraction
is the addition of a negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect
the results.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-454">
 $$ \text{A – B = A + }\left(\text{–B}\right). $$ 
</div>

This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example, $$ 5 – 2 =
5 + \left( –2 \right) $$ ). Again, the result is independent of the order in
which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the
techniques outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates.

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat
</div>
A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The 
instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction  $$ 66.0^\circ $$ 
north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction
$$ 112^\circ $$ north of east (or $$ 22.0^\circ $$ west of north). If the woman
makes a mistake and travels in the **opposite**
direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? Compare this
location with the location of the dock.

![A vector of magnitude twenty seven point five meters is shown. It is inclined to the horizontal at an angle of sixty six degrees. Another vector of magnitude thirty point zero meters is shown. It is inclined to the horizontal at an angle of one hundred and twelve degrees.](../resources/Figure_03_02_14.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165296408744}

**Strategy**

We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector $$ \vb{A}
$$, and the second leg of the trip with a vector $$ \vb{B} $$. The
dock is located at a location $$ \vb{A}+\vb{B} $$. If the
woman mistakenly travels in the *opposite* direction for the second leg of the
journey, she will travel a distance $$ B $$
(30.0 m) in the direction $$ 180^\circ –112^\circ =68^\circ $$ south of east. We
represent this as $$ \mathbf{\text{–B}} $$, as shown below. The vector $$
\mathbf{\text{–B}} $$ has the same magnitude as $$ \vb{B} $$ but is
in the opposite direction. Thus, she will end up at a location $$
\vb{A}+\left(
\mathbf{\text{–B}}\right) $$, or $$ \vb{A}–\vb{B} $$.

![A vector labeled negative B is inclined at an angle of sixty-eight degrees below a horizontal line. A dotted line in the reverse direction inclined at one hundred and twelve degrees above the horizontal line is also shown.](../resources/Figure_03_02_15a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165296408745}

We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock, 
$$ \vb{A} + \vb{B} $$, with the location at which the woman mistakenly arrives, $$
\vb{A} + \left(\text{–B}\right) $$.

**Solution**

(1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw
vectors $$ \vb{A} $$ and $$ \mathbf{\text{–B}} $$.

(2) Place the vectors head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector $$ \vb{R} $$.

(4) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction of $$
\vb{R} $$.

![Vectors A and negative B are connected in head to tail method. Vector A is inclined with horizontal with positive slope and vector negative B with a negative slope. The resultant of these two vectors is shown as a vector R from tail of A to the head of negative B. The length of the resultant is twenty three point zero meters and has a negative slope of seven point five degrees.](../resources/Figure_03_02_16a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165298476927}

In this case, $$ R=23.0 \text{m} $$ and $$ \theta =7.5^\circ $$ south of east.

(5) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to add vectors
$$ \vb{A} $$ and $$ \vb{B} $$. We obtain the resultant
vector $$ \vb{R}\text{'} $$ \:

![A vector A inclined at sixty six degrees with horizontal is shown. From the head of this vector another vector B is started. Vector B is inclined at one hundred and twelve degrees with the horizontal. Another vector labeled as R prime from the tail of vector A to the head of vector B is drawn. The length of this vector is fifty two point nine meters and its inclination with the horizontal is shown as ninety point one degrees. Vector R prime is equal to the sum of vectors A and B.](../resources/Figure_03_02_17a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id1165296298190}

In this case $$ R= 52.9 \text{m} $$ and $$ \theta =90.1^\circ $$ north of east.
We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the dock if
she travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip.

**Discussion**

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the
opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors works the same
as for addition.

</div>

### Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars

If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered
in the preceding example, then we would walk $$ 3 \times 27.5 \text{m} $$, or
82.5 m, in a direction $$ 66.0^\circ $$ north of east. This is an example of
multiplying a vector by a positive 
**scalar**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296219603}.
Notice that the magnitude changes, but the
direction stays the same.

If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s
magnitude and gives the new vector the **opposite** direction. For example, if
you multiply by –2, the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can
summarize these rules in the following way: When vector $$ \vb{A} $$ is
multiplied by a scalar $$ c $$,

* {: #import-auto-id1165298651742} the magnitude of the vector becomes the
  absolute value of $$| c A |$$ ,
* {: #import-auto-id1165298881521} if $$ c $$ is positive, the direction of the
  vector does not change,
* {: #import-auto-id1165298455414} if $$ c $$ is negative, the direction is
  reversed.

In our case, $$ c=3 $$ and $$ A=27.5 m $$. Vectors are multiplied by scalars in
many situations. Note that division is the inverse of multiplication. For
example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The rules
for multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply treat
the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1.

### Resolving a Vector into Components

In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant
vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the opposite. We will need to
take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it. In
most cases, this involves determining the
perpendicular **components**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298555736} 
of a single vector, for example the **x**- and **y**-components, 
or the north-south and east-west components.

For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a
city is 10.3 blocks in a direction $$29.0^\circ $$ north of east and want to
find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is
called **finding the components (or parts)** of the displacement in the east and
north directions, and it is the inverse of the process followed to find the
total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector.
There are many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We
will see this soon in [Projectile Motion](/contents/m42042), and much more when
we cover **forces**
in [Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion](/contents/m42129). Most of these involve
finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north and east), so that
right triangles are involved. The analytical techniques presented
in [Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods](/contents/m42128) are
ideal for finding vector components.

component (of a 2-d vector)
: a piece of a vector that points in either the vertical or the horizontal
direction; every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of two vertical and
horizontal vector components
{: #import-auto-id1165296580417}

commutative
: refers to the interchangeability of order in a function; vector addition is
commutative because the order in which vectors are added together does not
affect the final sum

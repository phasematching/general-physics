In contrast, at the subatomic level, the electrostatic attraction between two objects, such as an electron and a proton, is far greater than their mutual attraction due to gravity.

Through the work of scientists in the late 18th century, the main features of
the **electrostatic force**—the existence of two types of charge, the
observation that like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and the decrease of
force with distance—were eventually refined, and expressed as a mathematical
formula. The mathematical formula for the electrostatic force is called **
Coulomb’s law** after the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806), who
performed experiments and first proposed a formula to calculate it.

Coulomb’s Law
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}}. $$
</div>
Coulomb’s law calculates the magnitude of the force  $$F $$
 between two point charges,  $${q}_{1} $$
 and  $${q}_{2} $$ ,
 separated by a distance  $$r $$ .
 In SI units, the constant  $$k $$  is equal to

<div class="equation" >
 $$k= 8.988 \times 10^{9} \frac{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}{ {\text{C}}^{2}}\approx  8.99 \times 10^{9} \frac{\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}}{ {\text{C}}^{2}}. $$
</div>
The electrostatic force is a vector quantity and is expressed in units of newtons. The force is understood to be along the line joining the two charges. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).)

</div>

Although the formula for Coulomb’s law is simple, it was no mean task to prove
it. The experiments Coulomb did, with the primitive equipment then available,
were difficult. Modern experiments have verified Coulomb’s law to great
precision. For example, it has been shown that the force is inversely
proportional to distance between two objects squared $$\left(F\propto
1/{r}^{2}\right) $$ to an accuracy of 1 part in $$ 10^{16} $$ . No exceptions
have ever been found, even at the small distances within the atom.

<div class="title">
How Strong is the Coulomb Force Relative to the Gravitational Force?
</div>
Compare the electrostatic force between an electron and proton separated by  $$ 0.530 \times 10^{-10}  \text{m} $$
 with the gravitational force between them. This distance is their average separation in a hydrogen atom.

**Strategy**

To compare the two forces, we first compute the electrostatic force using
Coulomb’s law, $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}} $$ . We then calculate
the gravitational force using Newton’s universal law of gravitation. Finally, we
take a ratio to see how the forces compare in magnitude.

**Solution**

Entering the given and known information about the charges and separation of the
electron and proton into the expression of Coulomb’s law yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}} $$
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{}=\left( 8.99 \times 10^{9}  \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{C}}^{2}\right)×\frac{\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)}{ { \left(0.530 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}\right)}^{2}}\\ \end{array} $$
</div>
Thus the Coulomb force is

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=8.19 \times 10^{-8} \text{N}. $$
</div>
The charges are opposite in sign, so this is an attractive force. This is a very large force for an electron—it would cause an acceleration of  $$ 8.99 \times 10^{22}  \text{m}/{\text{s}}^{2} $$
(verification is left as an end-of-section problem).The gravitational force is given by Newton’s law of gravitation as:

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{G}=G\frac{mM}{ {r}^{2}}, $$
</div>
where  $$G= 6.67 \times 10^{-11}  \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{kg}}^{2} $$ .
 Here  $$m $$  and  $$M $$
 represent the electron and proton masses, which can be found in the appendices. Entering values for the knowns yields

<div class="equation" >
 $${F}_{G}=\left(6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{kg}}^{2}\right)×\frac{\left(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}\right)\left(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{kg}\right)}{ {`\left(0.530 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}\right)}^{2}}=3.61 \times 10^{-47} \text{N} $$
</div>
This is also an attractive force, although it is traditionally shown as positive since gravitational force is always attractive. The ratio of the magnitude of the electrostatic force to gravitational force in this case is, thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\frac{F}{ {F}_{G}}= 2.27  \times 10^{39}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is a remarkably large ratio! Note that this will be the ratio of
electrostatic force to gravitational force for an electron and a proton at any
distance (taking the ratio before entering numerical values shows that the
distance cancels). This ratio gives some indication of just how much larger the
Coulomb force is than the gravitational force between two of the most common
particles in nature.

</div>

As the example implies, gravitational force is completely negligible on a small
scale, where the interactions of individual charged particles are important. On
a large scale, such as between the Earth and a person, the reverse is true. Most
objects are nearly electrically neutral, and so attractive and repulsive **
Coulomb forces** nearly cancel. Gravitational force on a large scale dominates
interactions between large objects because it is always attractive, while
Coulomb forces tend to cancel.

### Section Summary

* Frenchman Charles Coulomb was the first to publish the mathematical equation
  that describes the electrostatic force between two objects.
* Coulomb’s law gives the magnitude of the force between point charges. It is

  <div class="equation" >
   $$F=k\frac{\|{q}_{1}{q}_{2}\|}{ {r}^{2}}, $$
  </div>

where $${q}_{1} $$ and $${q}_{2} $$ are two point charges separated by a
distance $$r $$ , and $$k\approx 8.99 \times 10^{9}
\text{N}·{\text{m}}^{2}/{\text{C}}^{2} $$

* This Coulomb force is extremely basic, since most charges are due to
  point-like particles. It is responsible for all electrostatic effects and
  underlies most macroscopic forces.
* The Coulomb force is extraordinarily strong compared with the gravitational
  force, another basic force—but unlike gravitational force it can cancel, since
  it can be either attractive or repulsive.
* The electrostatic force between two subatomic particles is far greater than
  the gravitational force between the same two particles.

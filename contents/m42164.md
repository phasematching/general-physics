We have seen that in an elastic collision, internal kinetic energy is conserved.
An **inelastic collision**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1572341} is one in
which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved). This lack of
conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may remove or add
internal kinetic energy. Work done by internal forces may change the forms of
energy within a system. For inelastic collisions, such as when colliding objects
stick together, this internal work may transform some internal kinetic energy
into heat transfer. Or it may convert stored energy into internal kinetic
energy, such as when exploding bolts separate a satellite from its launch
vehicle.

Inelastic Collision
</div>
An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved).

</div>

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1354002) shows an example of an inelastic collision.
Two objects that have equal masses head toward one another at equal speeds and
then stick together. Their total internal kinetic energy is initially $$
\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}=m v^{2} $$. The two objects come to rest
after sticking together, conserving momentum. But the internal kinetic energy is
zero after the collision. A collision in which the objects stick together is
sometimes called a **perfectly inelastic collision**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id1401573} because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than
does any other type of inelastic collision. In fact, such a collision reduces
internal kinetic energy to the minimum it can have while still conserving
momentum.

Perfectly Inelastic Collision
</div>
A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called “perfectly inelastic.”

</div>

![The system of interest contains two equal masses with mass m. One moves to the right and the other moves to the left with the same magnitude of velocity represented by V. Due to this their total momentum and net force remains zero. The internal kinetic energy is mv power 2. After collision the system of interest has no net velocity, no total momentum and no internal kinetic energy. This is true for all inelastic collisions.](../resources/Figure_09_05_01a.jpg "An inelastic one-dimensional two-object collision. Momentum is conserved, but internal kinetic energy is not conserved. (a) Two objects of equal mass initially head directly toward one another at the same speed. (b) The objects stick together (a perfectly inelastic collision), and so their final velocity is zero. The internal kinetic energy of the system changes in any inelastic collision and is reduced to zero in this example.")

Calculating Velocity and Change in Kinetic Energy: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie
</div>
(a) Find the recoil velocity of a 70.0-kg ice hockey goalie, originally at rest, who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of 35.0 m/s. (b) How much kinetic energy is lost during the collision? Assume friction between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1578036) )

![The first picture shows an ice hockey goal keeper of mass m 2 bent on his knees, turning to the left on a frictionless ice surface with zero velocity and a hockey puck of mass m 1 and velocity V 1 moving toward the right. The total momentum of the system is p 1 which is the momentum of the puck and the net force is zero. The second picture shows the goalie to catch the puck. The puck moves with velocity V 1prime and the goalie with velocity V 2 prime and their magnitudes are equal. The momentum of the puck is p 1 prime and the goalie is p 2 prime. The total momentum remains same as before collision. But the kinetic energy after collision is lesser than the kinetic energy before collision. This is true for inelastic collisions.](../resources/Figure_09_05_02a.jpg "An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward. The initial kinetic energy of the puck is almost entirely converted to thermal energy and sound in this inelastic collision.")
{: #import-auto-id1578036}

**Strategy**

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system
is zero. We can thus use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of
the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of the goalie is zero
and that the final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same. Once the final
velocity is found, the kinetic energies can be calculated before and after the
collision and compared as requested.

**Solution for (a)**

Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system
is zero.

Conservation of momentum is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-46">
 $$ p_{1}+p_{2}={p^{\prime} }_{1}+{p^{\prime} }_{2} $$ 
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-225">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}+m_{2}{v^{\prime} }_{2}. $$ 
</div>
Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know  $$ v_{2}=0 $$ . Because the goalie catches the puck, the final velocities are equal, or $$
{v^{\prime} }_{1}={v^{\prime} }_{2}=v^{\prime} $$. Thus, the conservation of momentum equation simplifies to

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-125">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v^{\prime} . $$ 
</div>
Solving for  $$ v^{\prime}  $$ yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-370">
 $$ v^{\prime} =\frac{ m_{1}}{ m_{1}+m_{2}}v_{1}. $$ 
</div>
Entering known values in this equation, we get

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-777">
 $$ v^{\prime} =\left(\frac{0.150 \text{kg}}{0.150 \text{kg}+70.0 \text{kg}}\right)\left(35.0 \text{m/s}\right)=7.48 \times 10^{-2}\text{m/s}. $$ 
</div>
**Discussion for (a)**

This recoil velocity is small and in the same direction as the puck’s original
velocity, as we might expect.

**Solution for (b)**

Before the collision, the internal kinetic energy $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{int}} $$
of the system is that of the hockey puck, because the goalie is initially at
rest. Therefore, $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{int}} $$ is initially

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-672">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{int}}& =& \frac{1}{2}m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(0.150 \text{kg}\right){\left(35.0 \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}\\ \text{}& =& 91.9 \text{J}.\end{array} $$ 
</div>
After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-440">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}\prime }_{\text{int}}& =& \frac{1}{2}\left(m+M\right){v}^{2}=
\frac{1}{2}\left(70.15 \text{kg}\right){\left(7.48 \times 10^{-2}\text{m/s}\right)}^{2}\\ & =& 
0.196 \text{J.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-172">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{KE^{\prime} }_{\text{int}}-{\text{KE}}_{\text{int}}& =& 0.196 \text{J}-91.9 \text{J}\\ & =& -91.7 \text{J}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
where the minus sign indicates that the energy was lost.

<strong>Discussion for (b) </strong>

Nearly all of the initial internal kinetic energy is lost in this perfectly
inelastic collision. $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{int}} $$ is mostly converted to
thermal energy and sound.

During some collisions, the objects do not stick together and less of the
internal kinetic energy is removed—such as happens in most automobile accidents.
Alternatively, stored energy may be converted into internal kinetic energy
during a collision. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1258204) shows a one-dimensional
example in which two carts on an air track collide, releasing potential energy
from a compressed spring. [\[link\]](#fs-id1487104) deals with data from such a
collision.

![An uncoiled spring is connected to a glider with triangular cross sectional area of mass m 1 which moves with velocity v 1 toward the right. Another solid glider of mass m 2 and triangular cross sectional area moves toward the left with velocity V 2 on a frictionless surface. The total momentum is the sum of their individual momentum p 1 and p 2. After collision m 1 moves to the left with velocity V 1 prime and momentum p 1prime. M 2 moves to the right with velocity V 2 prime. Their individual momentum becomes p 1prime and p 2 prime but the total momentum remains the same. The internal kinetic energy after collision is greater than the kinetic energy before collision.](../resources/Figure_09_05_03a.jpg "An air track is nearly frictionless, so that momentum is conserved. Motion is one-dimensional. In this collision, examined in [link], the potential energy of a compressed spring is released during the collision and is converted to internal kinetic energy.")
{: #import-auto-id1258204}

Collisions are particularly important in sports and the sporting and leisure
industry utilizes elastic and inelastic collisions. Let us look briefly at
tennis. Recall that in a collision, it is momentum and not force that is
important. So, a heavier tennis racquet will have the advantage over a lighter
one. This conclusion also holds true for other sports—a lightweight bat (such as
a softball bat) cannot hit a hardball very far.

The location of the impact of the tennis ball on the racquet is also important,
as is the part of the stroke during which the impact occurs. A smooth motion
results in the maximizing of the velocity of the ball after impact and reduces
sports injuries such as tennis elbow. A tennis player tries to hit the ball on
the “sweet spot” on the racquet, where the vibration and impact are minimized
and the ball is able to be given more velocity. Sports science and technologies
also use physics concepts such as momentum and rotational motion and vibrations.

Take-Home Experiment—Bouncing of Tennis Ball
</div>
1.  Find a racquet (a tennis, badminton, or other racquet will do). Place the racquet on the floor and stand on the handle. Drop a tennis ball on the strings from a measured height. Measure how high the ball bounces. Now ask a friend to hold the racquet firmly by the handle and drop a tennis ball from the same measured height above the racquet. Measure how high the ball bounces and observe what happens to your friend’s hand during the collision. Explain your observations and measurements.
2.  The coefficient of restitution $$ \left(c\right) $$ 
    is a measure of the elasticity of a collision between a ball and an object, and is defined as the ratio of the speeds after and before the collision. A perfectly elastic collision has a
     $$ c $$  of 1. For a ball bouncing off the floor (or a racquet on the 
floor),  $$ c $$  can be shown to be $$ c=\sqrt{\frac{h}{H}} $$ where $$ h 
$$  is the height to which the ball bounces and  $$ H $$ is the height from which the ball is dropped. 
Determine  $$ c $$  for the cases in Part 1 and for the case of a tennis ball bouncing off a concrete or wooden floor (
  $$ c=0.85 $$  for new tennis balls used on a tennis court).

Calculating Final Velocity and Energy Release: Two Carts Collide
</div>
In the collision pictured in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1258204), two carts collide inelastically. Cart 1 (denoted  $$ m_{1} $$ carries a spring which is initially compressed. During the collision, the spring
releases its potential energy and converts it to internal kinetic energy. The
mass of cart 1 and the spring is 0.350 kg, and the cart and the spring together
have an initial velocity of $$ 2.00 \text{m/s} $$. Cart 2 (denoted $$ m_{2} $$
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1258204)) has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial
velocity of $$ -0.500 \text{m/s} $$. After the collision, cart 1 is observed to recoil with a velocity of $$
-4.00 \text{m/s} $$. (a) What is the final velocity of cart 2? (b) How much energy was released by
the spring (assuming all of it was converted into internal kinetic energy)?

**Strategy**

We can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2,
because $$ F_{\text{net}}=0 $$
(the track is frictionless and the force of the spring is internal). Once this
velocity is determined, we can compare the internal kinetic energy before and
after the collision to see how much energy was released by the spring.

<strong> Solution for (a) </strong>

As before, the equation for conservation of momentum in a two-object system is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-473">
 $$ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}=m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}+m_{2}{v^{\prime} }_{2}. $$ 
</div>
The only unknown in this equation is  $$ {v^{\prime} }_{2} $$ . Solving for $$ {v^{\prime} }_{2} $$
and substituting known values into the previous equation yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-999">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{v^{\prime} }_{2}& =& 
\frac{ m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}-m_{1}{v^{\prime} }_{1}}{ m_{2}}\\ & =& 
\frac{\left(0.350 \text{kg}\right)\left(2.00 \text{m/s}\right)+
\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right)\left(-0.500 \text{m/s}\right)}{0.500 \text{kg}}-
\frac{\left(0.350 \text{kg}\right)\left(-4.00 \text{m/s}\right)}{0.500 \text{kg}}\\ & =& 
3.70 \text{m/s.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

The internal kinetic energy before the collision is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-530">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{int}}& =& \frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\\ & =& \frac{1}{2}\left(0.350 \text{kg}\right){\left(2.00 \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right){\left(–0.500 \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}\\ & =& 0.763 \text{J}.\end{array} $$ 
</div>
After the collision, the internal kinetic energy is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-626">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}\prime }_{\text{int}}& =& 
\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{v^{\prime}}_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{v^{\prime}}_{2}^{2}\\ & =& 
\frac{1}{2}\left(0.350 \text{kg}\right) \left(-4.00 \text{m/s}\right)^{2}+
\frac{1}{2}\left(0.500 \text{kg}\right) \left(3.70 \text{m/s}\right)^{2}\\ & =& 
6.22 \text{J.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
The change in internal kinetic energy is thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-246">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}KE^{\prime}_{\text{int}}-\text{KE}_{\text{int}}& =&
6.22 \text{J}-0.763 \text{J}\\ & =& 5.46 \text{J.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to
the right after the collision. The internal kinetic energy in this collision
increases by 5.46 J. That energy was released by the spring.

During a circus act, an elderly performer thrills the crowd by catching a cannon ball shot at him. The cannon ball has a mass of 10.0 kg and the horizontal component of its velocity is 8.00 m/s when the 65.0-kg performer catches it. If the performer is on nearly frictionless roller skates, what is his recoil velocity?

(a) During an ice skating performance, an initially motionless 80.0-kg clown throws a fake barbell away. The clown’s ice skates allow her to recoil frictionlessly. If the clown recoils with a velocity of 0.500 m/s and the barbell is thrown with a velocity of 10.0 m/s, what is the mass of the barbell? (b) How much kinetic energy is gained by this maneuver? (c) Where does the kinetic energy come from?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="eip-97" markdown="1">
(a) 4.00 kg

(b) 210 J

(c) The clown does work to throw the barbell, so the kinetic energy comes from
the muscles of the clown. The muscles convert the chemical potential energy of
ATP into kinetic energy.

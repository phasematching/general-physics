Rockets range in size from fireworks so small that ordinary people use them to
immense Saturn Vs that once propelled massive payloads toward the Moon. The
propulsion of all rockets, jet engines, deflating balloons, and even squids and
octopuses is explained by the same physical principle—Newton’s third law of
motion. Matter is forcefully ejected from a system, producing an equal and
opposite reaction on what remains. Another common example is the recoil of a
gun. The gun exerts a force on a bullet to accelerate it and consequently
experiences an equal and opposite force, causing the gun’s recoil or kick.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id2509052) shows a rocket accelerating straight up. In
part (a), the rocket has a mass $$ m $$ and a velocity $$ v $$ relative to
Earth, and hence a momentum $$ mgh $$. In part (b), a time $$ \Delta t $$ has
elapsed in which the rocket has ejected a mass $$ \Delta m $$ of hot gas at a
velocity $$ v_{\text{e}} $$ relative to the rocket. The remainder of the mass $$
\left(m-\Delta m\right)
$$ now has a greater velocity $$ \left(v+\Delta v\right) $$. The momentum of the
entire system (rocket plus expelled gas) has actually decreased because the
force of gravity has acted for a time $$ \Delta t $$, producing a negative
impulse $$ \Delta p=-mg \Delta t $$. (Remember that impulse is the net external
force on a system multiplied by the time it acts, and it equals the change in
momentum of the system.) So, the center of mass of the system is in free fall
but, by rapidly expelling mass, part of the system can accelerate upward. It is
a commonly held misconception that the rocket exhaust pushes on the ground. If
we consider thrust; that is, the force exerted on the rocket by the exhaust
gases, then a rocket’s thrust is greater in outer space than in the atmosphere
or on the launch pad. In fact, gases are easier to expel into a vacuum.

By calculating the change in momentum for the entire system over $$ \Delta t $$,
and equating this change to the impulse, the following expression can be shown
to be a good approximation for the acceleration of the rocket.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-188">
 $$ a=\frac{ v_{\text{e}}}{m}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}-g $$ 
</div>

“The rocket” is that part of the system remaining after the gas is ejected, and
$$ g $$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Acceleration of a Rocket
</div>
Acceleration of a rocket is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-653">
 $$ a=\frac{ v_{\text{e}}}{m}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}-g, $$ 
</div>
where  $$ a $$ 

is the acceleration of the rocket, $$ v_{\text{e}} $$ is the exhaust velocity,

![Picture a shows a rocket launched into space. It moves upward with velocity v in time t and the burning of fuel is also shown. After time t plus delta t the mass of fuel decreases by delta m and hence the velocity of the rocket increases to v plus delta v. The free body diagram shows the weight W of the rocket downward, reaction force upward and the resultant velocity upward too.](../resources/Figure_09_07_01a.jpg "(a) This rocket has a mass  \( m \)  and an upward velocity  \( v \) .

{: #import-auto-id2509052}

A rocket’s acceleration depends on three major factors, consistent with the
equation for acceleration of a rocket. First, the greater the
exhaust velocity of the gases relative to the rocket, $$ v_{\text{e}} $$, the
greater the acceleration is. The practical limit for $$ v_{\text{e}} $$ is
about $$ 2.5\times 10^{3}\text{m/s} $$ for conventional (non-nuclear) hot-gas
propulsion systems. The second factor is the rate at which mass is ejected from
the rocket. This is the factor $$ \Delta m/\Delta t $$ in the equation. The
quantity $$ \left(\Delta m/\Delta t\right)v_{\text{e}} $$, with units of
newtons, is called \"thrust.” The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater
its thrust, and the greater its acceleration. The third factor is the mass $$
m $$  of the rocket. The smaller the mass is (all other factors being the same), the
  greater the acceleration. The rocket mass  $$ m $$ decreases dramatically during flight because most of the rocket is fuel to
  begin with, so that acceleration increases continuously, reaching a maximum
  just before the fuel is exhausted.

Factors Affecting a Rocket’s Acceleration

<div data-type="title">
Calculating Acceleration: Initial Acceleration of a Moon Launch
</div>
A Saturn V’s mass at liftoff was  $$ 2.80\times 10^{6}\text{kg} $$ 

, its fuel-burn rate was $$ 1.40\times 10^{4}\text{kg/s} $$, and the exhaust
velocity was $$ 2.40\times 10^{3}\text{m/s} $$. Calculate its initial
acceleration.

**Strategy**

This problem is a straightforward application of the expression for acceleration
because  $$ a $$ is the unknown and all of the terms on the right side of the equation are
  given.

**Solution**

Substituting the given values into the equation for acceleration yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-13">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
a& =& \frac{ v_{\text{e}}}{m}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}-g\\ & =
&\frac{2.40\times 10^{3}\text{m/s}}{2.80\times 10^{6}\text{kg}}\left(1.40\times 10^{4}\text{kg/s}\right)-9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\\ & =
&2.20\text{m/s}^{2} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This value is fairly small, even for an initial acceleration. The acceleration
does increase steadily as the rocket burns fuel, because $$ m $$ decreases while
$$ v_{\text{e}} $$ and $$ \frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} $$ remain constant. Knowing
this acceleration and the mass of the rocket, you can show that the thrust of
the engines was $$ 3.36\times 10^{7}\text{N} $$.

</div>

To achieve the high speeds needed to hop continents, obtain orbit, or escape
Earth’s gravity altogether, the mass of the rocket other than fuel must be as
small as possible. It can be shown that, in the absence of air resistance and
neglecting gravity, the final velocity of a one-stage rocket initially at rest
is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-71">
 $$ v=v_{\text{e}}\text{ln}\frac{ m_{0}}{ m_{\text{r}}}, $$ 
</div>

where $$ \text{ln}\left(m_{0}/m_{\text{r}}\right) $$ is the natural logarithm of
the ratio of the initial mass of the rocket $$ \left(m_{0}\right) $$ to what is
left $$ \left(m_{\text{r}}\right) $$ after all of the fuel is exhausted. (Note
that $$ v $$ is actually the change in velocity, so the equation can be used for
any segment of the flight. If we start from rest, the change in velocity equals
the final velocity.) For example, let us calculate the mass ratio needed to
escape Earth’s gravity starting from rest, given that the escape velocity from
Earth is about $$ 11.2\times 10^{3}\text{m/s} $$, and assuming an exhaust
velocity $$ v_{\text{e}}=2.5\times 10^{3}\text{m/s} $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-31">
 $$ \text{ln}\frac{ m_{0}}{ m_{\text{r}}}=\frac{v}{ v_{\text{e}}}=\frac{11.2\times 10^{3}\text{m/s}}{2.5\times 10^{3}\text{m/s}}=4.48 $$ 
</div>

Solving for $$ m_{0}/m_{\text{r}} $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-607">
 $$ \frac{ m_{0}}{ m_{\text{r}}}={e}^{4.48}=88. $$ 
</div>

Thus, the mass of the rocket is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-263">
 $$ m_{\text{r}}=\frac{ m_{0}}{88}. $$ 
</div>

This result means that only $$ 1/88 $$ of the mass is left when the fuel is
burnt, and $$ 87/88 $$ of the initial mass was fuel. Expressed as percentages,
98.9% of the rocket is fuel, while payload, engines, fuel tanks, and other
components make up only 1.10%. Taking air resistance and gravitational force
into account, the mass $$ m_{\text{r}} $$ remaining can only be about $$ m_
{0}/180 $$. It is difficult to build a rocket in which the fuel has a mass 180
times everything else. The solution is multistage rockets. Each stage only needs
to achieve part of the final velocity and is discarded after it burns its fuel.
The result is that each successive stage can have smaller engines and more
payload relative to its fuel. Once out of the atmosphere, the ratio of payload
to fuel becomes more favorable, too.

The space shuttle was an attempt at an economical vehicle with some reusable
parts, such as the solid fuel boosters and the craft itself. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2998704)) The shuttle’s need to be operated by
humans, however, made it at least as costly for launching satellites as
expendable, unmanned rockets. Ideally, the shuttle would only have been used
when human activities were required for the success of a mission, such as the
repair of the Hubble space telescope. Rockets with satellites can also be
launched from airplanes. Using airplanes has the double advantage that the
initial velocity is significantly above zero and a rocket can avoid most of the
atmosphere’s resistance.

![The space shuttle is launched. It consists of the shuttle orbiter, two solid rocket boosters, and an expendable external tank. It takes off leaving much smoke and fire.](../resources/Figure_09_07_02a.jpg "The space shuttle had a number of reusable parts. Solid fuel boosters on either side were recovered and refueled after each flight, and the entire orbiter returned to Earth for use in subsequent flights. The large liquid fuel tank was expended. The space shuttle was a complex assemblage of technologies, employing both solid and liquid fuel and pioneering ceramic tiles as reentry heat shields. As a result, it permitted multiple launches as opposed to single-use rockets. (credit: NASA)")

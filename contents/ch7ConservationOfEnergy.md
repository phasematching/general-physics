### Law of Conservation of Energy

Energy, as we have noted, is conserved, making it one of the most important
physical quantities in nature. The **law of conservation of energy**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id2096012} can be stated as follows:

*Total energy is constant in any process. It may change in form or be
transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same.*

We have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from
one system to another. This exploration led to the definition of two major types
of energy—mechanical energy $$ \left(\KE+\PE\right) $$ and energy
transferred via work done by nonconservative forces $$ \left(W_
{\text{nc}}\right) $$. But energy takes *many* other forms, manifesting itself
in *many* different ways, and we need to be able to deal with all of these
before we can write an equation for the above general statement of the
conservation of energy.

### Other Forms of Energy than Mechanical Energy

At this point, we deal with all other forms of energy by lumping them into a
single group called other energy ( $$ \text{OE} $$).
Then we can state the conservation of energy in equation form as

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}+\text{OE}_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>

All types of energy and work can be included in this very general statement of
conservation of energy. Kinetic energy is $$ \KE $$, work done by a
conservative force is represented by $$ \PE $$, work done by
nonconservative forces is $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$, and all other energies are
included as $$ \text{OE} $$. This equation applies to all previous examples; in
those situations $$ \text{OE} $$ was constant, and so it subtracted out and was
not directly considered.

Making Connections: Usefulness of the Energy Conservation Principle
</div>
The fact that energy is conserved and has many forms makes it very important. You will find that energy is discussed in many contexts, because it is involved in all processes. It will also become apparent that many situations are best understood in terms of energy and that problems are often most easily conceptualized and solved by considering energy.

</div>

When does $$ \text{OE} $$ play a role? One example occurs when a person eats.
Food is oxidized with the release of carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Some of
this chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when the person moves, to
potential energy when the person changes altitude, and to thermal energy (
another form of $$ \text{OE} $$).

### Some of the Many Forms of Energy

What are some other forms of energy? You can probably name a number of forms of
energy not yet discussed. Many of these will be covered in later chapters, but
let us detail a few here. **Electrical energy**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id2771762} is a common form that is converted to many other forms
and does work in a wide range of practical situations. Fuels, such as gasoline
and food, carry **chemical energy**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2094176}
that can be transferred to a system through oxidation. Chemical fuel can also
produce electrical

energy, such as in batteries. Batteries can in turn produce light, which is a
very pure form of energy. Most energy sources on Earth are in fact stored energy
from the energy we receive from the Sun. We sometimes refer to this as **radiant
energy**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2739439}, or electromagnetic
radiation, which includes visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation.
**Nuclear energy**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2580734} comes from processes
that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy. Nuclear energy is
transformed into the energy of sunlight, into electrical energy in power plants,
and into the energy of the heat transfer and blast in weapons. Atoms and
molecules inside all objects are in random motion. This internal mechanical
energy from the random motions is called **thermal energy**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id2393416}, because it is related to the temperature of the object.
These and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do
work.

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id2866785) gives the amount of energy stored, used, or
released from various objects and in various phenomena. The range of energies
and the variety of types and situations is impressive.

<div data-type="title">
Problem-Solving Strategies for Energy
</div>
You will find the following problem-solving strategies useful whenever you deal with energy. The strategies help in organizing and reinforcing energy concepts. In fact, they are used in the examples presented in this chapter. The familiar general problem-solving strategies presented earlier—involving identifying physical principles, knowns, and unknowns, checking units, and so on—continue to be relevant here.

**Step 1.** Determine the system of interest and identify what information is
given and what quantity is to be calculated. A sketch will help.

**Step 2.** Examine all the forces involved and determine whether you know or
are given the potential energy from the work done by the forces. Then use step 3
or step 4.

**Step 3.** If you know the potential energies for the forces that enter into
the problem, then forces are all conservative, and you can apply conservation of
mechanical energy simply in terms of potential and kinetic energy. The equation
expressing conservation of energy is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-423">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>

**Step 4.** If you know the potential energy for only some of the forces, possibly because
some of them are nonconservative and do not have a potential energy, or if there are other
energies that are not easily treated in terms of force and work, then the conservation of
energy law in its most general form must be used.

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{\text{i}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}+\text{OE}_{\text{f}}. $$
</div>
In most problems, one or more of the terms is zero, simplifying its solution. Do not calculate $$ W_{c} $$, the work done by conservative forces; it is already incorporated in the $$
\PE $$ terms.

**Step 5.** You have already identified the types of work and energy involved (
in step 2). Before solving for the unknown, *eliminate terms wherever possible*
to simplify the algebra. For example, choose $$ h=0 $$ at either the initial or
final point, so that $$ \PE_{\text{g}} $$ is zero there. Then solve for
the unknown in the customary manner.

**Step 6.** *Check the answer to see if it is reasonable*. Once you have solved
a problem, reexamine the forms of work and energy to see if you have set up the
conservation of energy equation correctly. For example, work done against
friction should be negative, potential energy at the bottom of a hill should be
less than that at the top, and so on. Also check to see that the numerical value
obtained is reasonable. For example, the final speed of a skateboarder who
coasts down a 3-m-high ramp could reasonably be 20 km/h, but *not* 80 km/h.

</div>

### Transformation of Energy

The transformation of energy from one form into others is happening all the
time. The chemical energy in food is converted into thermal energy through
metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through
photosynthesis. In a larger example, the chemical energy contained in coal is
converted into thermal energy as it burns to turn water into steam in a boiler.
This thermal energy in the steam in turn is converted to mechanical energy as it
spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical
energy. (In all of these examples, not all of the initial energy is converted
into the forms mentioned. This important point is discussed later in this
section.)

Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging
on a solar cell (
see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1626980)) produces electricity, which in turn can
be used to run an electric motor. Energy is converted from the primary source of
solar energy into electrical energy and then into mechanical energy.

Solar cells are on the upper surface of the wings, where they are exposed to sunlight.](../resources/Figure_08_06_01a.jpg "Solar energy is converted into electrical energy by solar cells, which is used to run a motor in this solar-power aircraft.

### Efficiency

Even though energy is conserved in an energy conversion process, the output of
*useful energy* or work will be less than the energy input. The **efficiency**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id2408157 } $$ \text{Eff} $$ of an energy
conversion process is defined as

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \text{Efficiency}\left(\text{Eff}\right)=\frac{ \text{useful energy or work output}}{\text{total energy input}}=\frac{ W_{\text{out}}}{ E_{\text{in}}}. $$
</div>

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1330125) lists some efficiencies of mechanical devices
and human activities. In a coal-fired power plant, for example, about 40% of the
chemical energy in the coal becomes useful electrical energy. The other 60%
transforms into other (perhaps less useful) energy forms, such as thermal
energy, which is then released to the environment through combustion gases and
cooling towers.

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1537867} The law of conservation of energy states that the
  total energy is constant in any process. Energy may change in form or be
  transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same.
* {: #import-auto-id1839690} When all forms of energy are considered,
  conservation of energy is written in equation form as $$ \KE_
  {i}+\PE_{i}+W_{\text{nc}}+\text{OE}_{i}=\KE_
  {f}+\PE_{f}+\text{OE}_{f} $$, where $$ \text{OE} $$ is all **other
  forms of energy** besides mechanical energy.
* {: #import-auto-id1317294} Commonly encountered forms of energy include
  electric energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, and thermal
  energy.
* {: #import-auto-id1787512} Energy is often utilized to do work, but it is not
  possible to convert all the energy of a system to work.
* {: #import-auto-id1628394} The efficiency $$ \text{Eff} $$ of a machine or
  human is defined to be $$ \text{Eff}=\frac{ W_{\text{out}}}{ E_{\text{in}}}
 $$, where $$ W_{\text{out}} $$ is useful work output and $$ E_{\text{in}} $$ is the energy consumed.

### Conceptual Questions

<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Consider the following scenario. A car for which friction is *not* negligible accelerates from rest down a hill, running out of gasoline after a short distance. The driver lets the car coast farther down the hill, then up and over a small crest. He then coasts down that hill into a gas station, where he brakes to a stop and fills the tank with gasoline. Identify the forms of energy the car has, and how they are changed and transferred in this series of events. (See [[link]](#import-auto-id2100801).)

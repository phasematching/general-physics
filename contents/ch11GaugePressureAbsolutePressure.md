If you limp into a gas station with a nearly flat tire, you will notice the tire
gauge on the airline reads nearly zero when you begin to fill it. In fact, if
there were a gaping hole in your tire, the gauge would read zero, even though
atmospheric pressure exists in the tire. Why does the gauge read zero? There is
no mystery here. Tire gauges are simply designed to read zero at atmospheric
pressure and positive when pressure is greater than atmospheric.

Similarly, atmospheric pressure adds to blood pressure in every part of the
circulatory system. (As noted in [Pascal’s Principle](../contents/ch11PascalsPrinciple),
the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different
sources—here, the heart and the atmosphere.) But atmospheric pressure has no net
effect on blood flow since it adds to the pressure coming out of the heart and
going back into it, too. What is important is how much *greater* blood pressure
is than atmospheric pressure. Blood pressure measurements, like tire pressures,
are thus made relative to atmospheric pressure.

In brief, it is very common for pressure gauges to ignore atmospheric
pressure—that is, to read zero at atmospheric pressure. We therefore define **gauge pressure** to be the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Gauge
pressure is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for
pressures below it.

Gauge Pressure
</div>
Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. Gauge pressure is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it.

</div>

In fact, atmospheric pressure does add to the pressure in any fluid not enclosed
in a rigid container. This happens because of Pascal’s principle. The total
pressure, or **absolute pressure**, is thus the sum of gauge pressure and
atmospheric pressure:  $${P}_{\text{abs}}={P}_{\text{g}}+{P}_{\text{atm}} $$
where $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ is absolute pressure, $${P}_{\text{g}} $$ is gauge
pressure, and $${P}_{\text{atm}} $$ is atmospheric pressure. For example, if
your tire gauge reads 34 psi (pounds per square inch), then the absolute
pressure is 34 psi plus 14.7 psi ( $${P}_{\text{atm}} $$ in psi), or 48.7 psi (
equivalent to 336 kPa).

<div class="title">
Absolute Pressure
</div>
Absolute pressure is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure.

</div>

For reasons we will explore later, in most cases the absolute pressure in fluids
cannot be negative. Fluids push rather than pull, so the smallest absolute
pressure is zero. (A negative absolute pressure is a pull.) Thus the smallest
possible gauge pressure is $${P}_{\text{g}}=-{P}_{\text{atm}} $$
(this makes $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ zero). There is no theoretical limit to how
large a gauge pressure can be.

There are a host of devices for measuring pressure, ranging from tire gauges to
blood pressure cuffs. Pascal’s principle is of major importance in these
devices. The undiminished transmission of pressure through a fluid allows
precise remote sensing of pressures. Remote sensing is often more convenient
than putting a measuring device into a system, such as a person’s artery.

[[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows one of the many types of mechanical pressure gauges
in use today. In all mechanical pressure gauges, pressure results in a force
that is converted (or transduced) into some type of readout.

![Aneroid gauge measures pressure using a bellows and spring arrangement connected to the pointer that points to a calibrated scale.](../resources/Figure_11_06_01.jpg "This aneroid gauge utilizes flexible bellows connected to a mechanical indicator to measure pressure.")
{: #Figure1}

An entire class of gauges uses the property that pressure due to the weight of a
fluid is given by $$P=h \rho g\text{.} $$ Consider the U-shaped tube shown
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), for example. This simple tube is called a *manometer*
. In [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(a), both sides of the tube are open to the
atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure therefore pushes down on each side equally so
its effect cancels. If the fluid is deeper on one side, there is a greater
pressure on the deeper side, and the fluid flows away from that side until the
depths are equal.

Let us examine how a manometer is used to measure pressure. Suppose one side of
the U-tube is connected to some source of pressure $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ such as
the toy balloon in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(b) or the vacuum-packed peanut jar
shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(c). Pressure is transmitted undiminished to the
manometer, and the fluid levels are no longer equal. In [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(
b), $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ is greater than atmospheric pressure, whereas
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(c), $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ is less than atmospheric
pressure. In both cases, $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ differs from atmospheric pressure
by an amount $$h \rho g $$ , where $$\rho $$ is the density of the fluid in the
manometer. In [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(b), $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ can support a
column of fluid of height $$h $$ , and so it must exert a pressure $$h \rho g $$
greater than atmospheric pressure (the gauge pressure $${P}_{\text{g}} $$ is
positive). In [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)(c), atmospheric pressure can support a
column of fluid of height $$h $$ , and so $${P}_{\text{abs}} $$ is less than
atmospheric pressure by an amount $$h \rho g $$
(the gauge pressure $${P}_{\text{g}} $$ is negative). A manometer with one side
open to the atmosphere is an ideal device for measuring gauge pressures. The
gauge pressure is $${P}_{\text{g}}=h \rho g $$ and is found by measuring $$h $$.

![Open-tube manometers have U-shaped tubes and one end is always open. When open to atmosphere, fluid at both ends will be the same, as in the first figure. When pressure at one end is greater, the fluid level will go down on that end, as in the second figure. If the pressure at one end is less, then the height of the fluid column on that side will increase, as in the third figure.](../resources/Figure_11_06_02.jpg "An open-tube manometer has one side open to the atmosphere. (a) Fluid depth must be the same on both sides, or the pressure each side exerts at the bottom will be unequal and there will be flow from the deeper side. (b) A positive gauge pressure \( P_g=h\rho g \) transmitted to one side of the manometer can support a column of fluid of height \( h \) . (c) Similarly, atmospheric pressure is greater than a negative gauge pressure \( P_{g} \) by an amount \( h\rho g \). The jar&#x2019;s rigidity prevents atmospheric pressure from being transmitted to the peanuts.")

Mercury manometers are often used to measure arterial blood pressure. An
inflatable cuff is placed on the upper arm as shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).
By squeezing the bulb, the person making the measurement exerts pressure, which
is transmitted undiminished to both the main artery in the arm and the
manometer. When this applied pressure exceeds blood pressure, blood flow below
the cuff is cut off. The person making the measurement then slowly lowers the
applied pressure and listens for blood flow to resume. Blood pressure pulsates
because of the pumping action of the heart, reaching a maximum, called **systolic pressure**, and a minimum, called **diastolic pressure**, with each
heartbeat. Systolic pressure is measured by noting the value of $$h $$ when
blood flow first begins as cuff pressure is lowered. Diastolic pressure is
measured by noting $$h $$ when blood flows without interruption. The typical
blood pressure of a young adult raises the mercury to a height of 120 mm at
systolic and 80 mm at diastolic. This is commonly quoted as 120 over 80, or
120/80. The first pressure is representative of the maximum output of the heart;
the second is due to the elasticity of the arteries in maintaining the pressure
between beats. The density of the mercury fluid in the manometer is 13.6 times
greater than water, so the height of the fluid will be 1/13.6 of that in a water
manometer. This reduced height can make measurements difficult, so mercury
manometers are used to measure larger pressures, such as blood pressure. The
density of mercury is such that $$1.0 \text{mm Hg}=133 \text{Pa} $$.

Calculating Height of IV Bag: Blood Pressure and Intravenous Infusions
</div>
Intravenous infusions are usually made with the help of the gravitational force. Assuming that the density of the fluid being administered is 1.00 g/ml, at what height should the IV bag be placed above the entry point so that the fluid just enters the vein if the blood pressure in the vein is 18 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure? Assume that the IV bag is collapsible.

**Strategy for (a)**

For the fluid to just enter the vein, its pressure at entry must exceed the
blood pressure in the vein (18 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure). We therefore
need to find the height of fluid that corresponds to this gauge pressure.

**Solution**

We first need to convert the pressure into SI units. Since $$1.0 \text{mm
Hg}=133 \text{Pa} $$ ,

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=18 \text{mm Hg}×\frac{133 \text{Pa}}{1.0 \text{mm Hg}}=2400 \text{Pa}\text{.} $$
</div>
Rearranging  $${P}_{\text{g}}=h \rho g $$  for  $$h $$
 gives  $$h=\frac{ {P}_{\text{g}}}{\rho g} $$ .
 Substituting known values into this equation gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}h& =& \frac{2400 \text{N}{\text{/m}}^{2}}{\left( 1.0 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)}\\ & =& 0.24 \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The IV bag must be placed at 0.24 m above the entry point into the arm for the
fluid to just enter the arm. Generally, IV bags are placed higher than this. You
may have noticed that the bags used for blood collection are placed below the
donor to allow blood to flow easily from the arm to the bag, which is the
opposite direction of flow than required in the example presented here.

</div>

A *barometer* is a device that measures atmospheric pressure. A mercury
barometer is shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). This device measures atmospheric
pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum
above the mercury in the tube. The height of the mercury is such that $$h \rho
g={P}_{\text{atm}} $$ . When atmospheric pressure varies, the mercury rises or
falls, giving important clues to weather forecasters. The barometer can also be
used as an altimeter, since average atmospheric pressure varies with altitude.
Mercury barometers and manometers are so common that units of mm Hg are often
quoted for atmospheric pressure and blood pressures. [[Table 1]](#Table1) gives
conversion factors for some of the more commonly used units of pressure.

![Mercury barometer has an evacuated glass tube inverted and placed in the mercury container. The height of the mercury column in the inverted tube is determined by the atmospheric pressure.](../resources/Figure_11_06_04.jpg "A mercury barometer measures atmospheric pressure. The pressure due to the mercury&#x2019;s weight, \( h\rho g \), equals atmospheric pressure. The atmosphere is able to force mercury in the tube to a height \( h \) because the pressure above the mercury is zero.")

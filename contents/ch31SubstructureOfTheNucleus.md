What is inside the nucleus? Why are some nuclei stable while others decay? (
See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) Why are there different types of decay ( $$\alpha
$$ , $$\beta $$ and $$\gamma $$ )  ? Why are nuclear decay energies so large?
Pursuing natural questions like these has led to far more fundamental
discoveries than you might imagine.

Third image shows a cylindrical glass tube containing slivery-brown cesium.](../resources/Figure_31_03_01a.jpg "Why is most of the carbon in this coal stable (a), while the uranium in the disk (b) slowly decays over billions of years? Why is cesium in this ampule (c) even less stable than the uranium, decaying in far less than 1/1 000 000 the time? What is the reason uranium and cesium undergo different types of decay (\( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), respectively)?

We have already identified **protons** as the particles that carry positive
charge in the nuclei. However, there are actually *two* types of particles in
the nuclei—the *proton* and the *neutron*, referred to collectively as **nucleons**, the constituents of nuclei. As its name implies, the **neutron** is
a neutral particle ( $$q=0 $$ )
that has nearly the same mass and intrinsic spin as the
proton. [[Table 1]](#Table1) compares the masses of protons, neutrons, and
electrons. Note how close the proton and neutron masses are, but the neutron is
slightly more massive once you look past the third digit. Both nucleons are much
more massive than an electron. In fact, $${m}_{p}=1836{m}_{e} $$
(as noted in [Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics](../contents/ch32MedicalApplicationsOfNuclearPhysics) and $${m}_
{n}=1839{m}_{e} $$.

[[Table 1]](#Table1) also gives masses in terms of mass units that are more
convenient than kilograms on the atomic and nuclear scale. The first of these is
the *unified **atomic mass**{: class="term"} unit* (u), defined as

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{u}= 1.6605 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg} \text{.}  $$
</div>

This unit is defined so that a neutral carbon $${}^{12}\text{C} $$ atom has a
mass of exactly 12 u. Masses are also expressed in units of $$\text{MeV/}{c}^{2}
$$ . These units are very convenient when considering the conversion of mass
into energy (and vice versa), as is so prominent in nuclear processes. Using
$$E=mc^{2} $$ and units of $$m $$ in $$\text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ , we find that
$${c}^{2} $$ cancels and $$E $$ comes out conveniently in MeV. For example, if
the rest mass of a proton is converted entirely into energy, then

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=mc^{2}=\left(938.27 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2}\right){c}^{2}=938.27 \text{MeV} \text{.}  $$
</div>

It is useful to note that 1 u of mass converted to energy produces 931.5 MeV, or

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{u}=931.5 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2}. $$
</div>

All properties of a nucleus are determined by the number of protons and neutrons
it has. A specific combination of protons and neutrons is called a **nuclide**
and is a unique nucleus. The following notation is used to represent a
particular nuclide:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}, $$
</div>

where the symbols $$A $$ , $$\text{X} $$ , $$Z $$ , and $$N $$ are defined as
follows: The *number of protons in a nucleus* is the **atomic number**  $$Z $$ ,
as defined in [Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics](../contents/ch32MedicalApplicationsOfNuclearPhysics). X is the *
symbol for the element*, such as Ca for calcium. However, once $$Z $$ is known,
the element is known; hence, $$Z $$ and $$\text{X} $$ are redundant. For
example, $$Z=20 $$ is always calcium, and calcium always has $$Z=20 $$ . $$N $$
is the *number of neutrons* in a nucleus. In the notation for a nuclide, the
subscript $$N $$ is usually omitted. The symbol $$A $$ is defined as the number
of nucleons or the *total number of protons and neutrons*,

<div class="equation" >
 $$A=N+Z, $$
</div>

where $$A $$ is also called the **mass number**. This name for $$A $$ is
logical; the mass of an atom is nearly equal to the mass of its nucleus, since
electrons have so little mass. The mass of the nucleus turns out to be nearly
equal to the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons in it, which is
proportional to $$A $$ . In this context, it is particularly convenient to
express masses in units of u. Both protons and neutrons have masses close to 1
u, and so the mass of an atom is close to $$A $$ u. For example, in an oxygen
nucleus with eight protons and eight neutrons, $$A=16 $$ , and its mass is 16 u.
As noticed, the unified atomic mass unit is defined so that a neutral carbon
atom (actually a $${}^{12}\text{C} $$ atom) has a mass of *exactly* 12
$$\text{u} $$ . Carbon was chosen as the standard, partly because of its
importance in organic chemistry (see [Appendix A](../contents/appendixA)).

Let us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the $${}_
{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N} $$ notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen,
is a single proton, or $${}_{1}^{1}\text{H} $$
(the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check this symbol, refer to the
periodic table—you see that the atomic number $$Z $$ of hydrogen is 1. Since you
are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number $$A $$ is also 1. Suppose
you are told that the helium nucleus or $$\alpha $$ particle has two protons and
two neutrons. You can then see that it is written $${}_{2}^{4}{\text{He}}_{2} $$
. There is a scarce form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its
nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of common
hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus, $${}_{1}^{2}{\text{H}}_{1} $$
(sometimes $$\text{D} $$ is used, as for deuterated water $${\text{D}}_
{2}\text{O} $$ ). An even rarer—and radioactive—form of hydrogen is called
tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written $${}_
{1}^{3}{\text{H}}_{2} $$ . These three varieties of hydrogen have nearly
identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and
other characteristics. Nuclei (such as those of hydrogen) having the same $$Z $$
and different $$N $$ s are defined to be **isotopes** of the same element.

There is some redundancy in the symbols $$A $$ , $$\text{X} $$ , $$Z $$ , and
$$N $$ . If the element $$\text{X} $$ is known, then $$Z $$ can be found in a
periodic table and is always the same for a given element. If both $$A $$ and
$$\text{X} $$ are known, then $$N $$ can also be determined (first find $$Z $$ ;
then, $$N=A-Z $$ ). Thus the simpler notation for nuclides is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{A}\text{X}, $$
</div>

which is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler
notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are $${}^{1}\text{H} \text{,}
{}^{2}\text{H} \text{,} $$ and $${}^{3}\text{H} \text{,} $$ while the $$\alpha
$$ particle is $${}^{4}\text{He} $$ . We read this backward, saying helium-4 for
$${}^{4}\text{He} $$ , or uranium-238 for $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ . So for
$${}^{238}\text{U} $$ , should we need to know, we can determine that $$Z=92 $$
for uranium from the periodic table, and, thus, $$N=238-92=146 $$.

A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a
tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). These
nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close
contact. Nucleons can be separated by a large force, such as in a collision with
another nucleus, but resist strongly being pushed closer together. The most
compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the **radius of a nucleus**, $$r $$ , is found to be given approximately by

<div class="equation" >
 $$r={r}_{0}{A}^{1/3}, $$
</div>

where $${r}_{0}=1.2 \text{fm} $$ and $$A $$ is the mass number of the nucleus.
Note that $${r}^{3}\propto A $$ . Since many nuclei are spherical, and the
volume of a sphere is $$V=\left(4/3\right)\pi r^{3} $$ , we see that $$V\propto
A $$ —that is, the volume of a nucleus is proportional to the number of nucleons
in it. This is what would happen if you pack nucleons so closely that there is
no empty space between them.

![This figure shows group of small green and blue spherical objects placed very close to each other forming a bigger sphere representing the nucleus. Blue spheres are labeled as protons and green spheres are labeled as neutrons.](../resources/Figure_31_03_02a.jpg "A model of the nucleus.")
{: #Figure2}

Nucleons are held together by nuclear forces and resist both being pulled apart
and pushed inside one another. The volume of the nucleus is the sum of the
volumes of the nucleons in it, here shown in different colors to represent
protons and neutrons.

How Small and Dense Is a Nucleus?
</div>
(a) Find the radius of an iron-56 nucleus. (b) Find its approximate density in  $$kg/{m}^{3} $$ ,
 approximating the mass of  $${}^{56}\text{Fe} $$
 to be 56 u.

**Strategy and Concept**

(a) Finding the radius of $${}^{56}\text{Fe} $$ is a straightforward application
of $$r={r}_{0}{A}^{1/3}, $$ given $$A=56 $$ .
(b) To find the approximate density, we assume the nucleus is spherical (this
one actually is), calculate its volume using the radius found in part (a), and
then find its density from $$\rho =m/V $$ . Finally, we will need to convert
density from units of $$\text{u}/\text{fm}^{3} $$ to $$\text{kg}/\text{m}^{3}
$$.

**Solution**

(a) The radius of a nucleus is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$r={r}_{0}{A}^{1/3}. $$
</div>
Substituting the values for  $${r}_{0} $$  and  $$A $$  yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}r& =& {\left(1.2 \text{fm}\right)\left(56\right)}^{1/3}=\left(1.2 \text{fm}\right)\left(3.83\right)\\ & =& 4.6 \text{fm}.\end{array} $$
</div>
(b) Density is defined to be  $$\rho =m/V $$ ,
 which for a sphere of radius  $$r $$ is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\rho =\frac{m}{V}=\frac{m}{\left(4/3\right)\pi r^{3}}. $$
</div>
Substituting known values gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\rho & =& \frac{56 \text{u}}{\left(1.33\right)\left(3.14\right){\left(4.6 \text{fm}\right)}^{3}}\\ & =& 0.138 \text{u}/\text{fm}^{3}.\end{array} $$
</div>
Converting to units of  $$kg/{m}^{3} $$ ,
 we find

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\rho & =& \left(0.138 \text{u}/\text{fm}^{3}\right)\left(1.66 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg/u}\right)\left(\frac{1 \text{fm}}{ {10}^{-15} \text{m}}\right)\\ & =& 2.3 \times 10^{17}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

(a) The radius of this medium-sized nucleus is found to be approximately 4.6 fm,
and so its diameter is about 10 fm, or $${10}^{-14} \text{m} $$ . In our
discussion of Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus, we noticed that it is about
$${10}^{-15} \text{m} $$ in diameter (which is for lighter nuclei), consistent
with this result to an order of magnitude. The nucleus is much smaller in
diameter than the typical atom, which has a diameter of the order of
$${10}^{-10} \text{m} $$.

(b) The density found here is so large as to cause disbelief. It is consistent
with earlier discussions we have had about the nucleus being very small and
containing nearly all of the mass of the atom. Nuclear densities, such as found
here, are about $$2 \times 10^{14} $$ times greater than that of water, which
has a density of “only” $${10}^{3} {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ . One cubic meter of
nuclear matter, such as found in a neutron star, has the same mass as a cube of
water 61 km on a side.

</div>

### Nuclear Forces and Stability

What forces hold a nucleus together? The nucleus is very small and its protons,
being positive, exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. (The Coulomb
force increases as charges get closer, since it is proportional to $$1/{r}^{2}
$$ , even at the tiny distances found in nuclei.) The answer is that two
previously unknown forces hold the nucleus together and make it into a tightly
packed ball of nucleons. These forces are called the *weak and strong nuclear
forces*. Nuclear forces are so short ranged that they fall to zero strength when
nucleons are separated by only a few fm. However, like glue, they are strongly
attracted when the nucleons get close to one another. The strong nuclear force
is about 100 times more attractive than the repulsive EM force, easily holding
the nucleons together. Nuclear forces become extremely repulsive if the nucleons
get too close, making nucleons strongly resist being pushed inside one another,
something like ball bearings.

The fact that nuclear forces are very strong is responsible for the very large
energies emitted in nuclear decay. During decay, the forces do work, and since
work is force times the distance ( $$W=Fd \cos \theta $$ ), a large force can
result in a large emitted energy. In fact, we know that there are *two* distinct
nuclear forces because of the different types of nuclear decay—the strong
nuclear force is responsible for $$\alpha $$ decay, while the weak nuclear force
is responsible for $$\beta $$ decay.

The many stable and unstable nuclei we have explored, and the hundreds we have
not discussed, can be arranged in a table called the **chart of the nuclides**,
a simplified version of which is shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Nuclides are
located on a plot of $$N $$ versus $$Z $$ . Examination of a detailed chart of
the nuclides reveals patterns in the characteristics of nuclei, such as
stability, abundance, and types of decay, analogous to but more complex than the
systematics in the periodic table of the elements.

![A chart of nuclides is shown with x axis labeled as number of protons or atomic number with range zero to one hundred ten and y axis labeled as number of neutrons with range zero to one hundred sixty. A straight dashed line is shown for equal atomic number and number of nuclides. A number of points are plotted above the dashed line. The region up to atomic number eighty and neutron number one hundred thirty is shown as stable nuclei and above this region is unstable nuclei.](../resources/Figure_31_03_03a.jpg "Simplified chart of the nuclides, a graph of \( N \) versus \( Z \) for known nuclides. The patterns of stable and unstable nuclides reveal characteristics of the nuclear forces. The dashed line is for \( N=Z \) . Numbers along diagonals are mass numbers \( A \) .")
{: #Figure3}

In principle, a nucleus can have any combination of protons and neutrons,
but [[Figure 3]](#Figure3) shows a definite pattern for those that are stable.
For low-mass nuclei, there is a strong tendency for $$N $$ and $$Z $$ to be
nearly equal. This means that the nuclear force is more attractive when $$N=Z $$
. More detailed examination reveals greater stability when $$N $$ and $$Z $$ are
even numbers—nuclear forces are more attractive when neutrons and protons are in
pairs. For increasingly higher masses, there are progressively more neutrons
than protons in stable nuclei. This is due to the ever-growing repulsion between
protons. Since nuclear forces are short ranged, and the Coulomb force is long
ranged, an excess of neutrons keeps the protons a little farther apart, reducing
Coulomb repulsion. Decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability
consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability. There are more
stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons, called **magic
numbers**. Magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which
closed shells are more stable. Nuclear shell theory has been very successful in
explaining nuclear energy levels, nuclear decay, and the greater stability of
nuclei with closed shells. We have been producing ever-heavier transuranic
elements since the early 1940s, and we have now produced the element with
$$Z=118 $$ . There are theoretical predictions of an island of relative
stability for nuclei with such high $$Z $$ s.

### Section Summary

* Two particles, both called nucleons, are found inside nuclei. The two types of
  nucleons are protons and neutrons; they are very similar, except that the
  proton is positively charged while the neutron is neutral. Some of their
  characteristics are given in [[Table 1]](#Table1) and compared with those of
  the electron. A mass unit convenient to atomic and nuclear processes is the
  unified atomic mass unit (u), defined to be
  <div class="equation" >
   $$1 u= 1.6605 \times 10^{-27}  \text{kg}=931.46 \text{MeV}/{c}^{2}. $$
  </div>

* A nuclide is a specific combination of protons and neutrons, denoted by
  <div class="equation" >
   $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N} \text{or simply}{}^{A}\text{X} \text{,}  $$
  </div>

  $$Z $$ is the number of protons or atomic number, X is the symbol for the
  element, $$N $$ is the number of neutrons, and $$A $$ is the mass number or
  the total number of protons and neutrons,
  <div class="equation" >
   $$A=N+Z. $$
  </div>

* Nuclides having the same $$Z $$ but different $$N $$ are isotopes of the same
  element.
* The radius of a nucleus, $$r $$ , is approximately
  <div class="equation" >
   $$r={r}_{0}{A}^{1/3}, $$
  </div>
     where
   $${r}_{0}=1.2 \text{fm} $$ . 

Nuclear volumes are proportional to $$A $$ . There are two nuclear forces, the
weak and the strong. Systematics in nuclear stability seen on the chart of the
nuclides indicate that there are shell closures in nuclei for values of $$Z $$
and $$N $$ equal to the magic numbers, which correspond to highly stable nuclei.

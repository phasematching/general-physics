* Explain the gyroscopic effect.
* Study how Earth acts like a gigantic gyroscope.

</div>

Angular momentum is a vector and, therefore, *has direction as well as
magnitude*. Torque affects both the direction and the magnitude of angular
momentum. What is the direction of the angular momentum of a rotating object
like the disk in [Figure 1](#fig1)? The figure shows the
**right-hand rule** used to find the direction of both angular momentum and
angular velocity. Both $$ \vb{L} $$ and $$ \vb{\omega} $$ are vectors—each has
direction and magnitude. Both can be represented by arrows. The right-hand rule
defines both to be perpendicular to the plane of rotation in the direction
shown. Because angular momentum is related to angular velocity by $$
\vb{L}=I^\prime \vb{\omega}^\prime $$, the direction of $$ \vb{L} $$ is the same
as the direction of $$ \vb{\omega} $$. Notice in the figure that both point
along the axis of rotation.

![In figure a, a disk is rotating in counter clockwise direction. The direction of the angular momentum is shown as an upward vector at the centre of the disk. The vector is labeled as L is equal to I-omega. In figure b, a right hand is shown. The fingers are curled in the direction of rotation and the thumb is pointed vertically upward in the direction of angular velocity and angular momentum.](../resources/Figure_11_07_01a.jpg "Figure (a) shows a disk is rotating counterclockwise when viewed from above. Figure (b) shows the right-hand rule. The direction of angular velocity \( \vb{\omega} \) and angular momentum \( \vb{L} \) are defined to be the direction in which the thumb of your right hand points when you curl your fingers in the direction of the disk&#x2019;s rotation as shown.")

Now, recall that torque changes angular momentum as expressed by

<div class="equation">
 $$ \text{net} \vb{\tau}=\frac{ \Delta \vb{L}}{\Delta t}. $$
</div>

This equation means that the direction of $$ \Delta \vb{L} $$ is the same as the
direction of the torque $$ \vb{\tau} $$ that creates it. This result is
illustrated in [Figure 2](#fig2), which shows the direction of torque and the
angular momentum it creates.

Let us now consider a bicycle wheel with a couple of handles attached to it, as
shown in [Figure 3](#fig3). (This device is popular in demonstrations among
physicists, because it does unexpected things.) With the wheel rotating as
shown, its angular momentum is to the woman\'s left. Suppose the person holding
the wheel tries to rotate it as in the figure. Her natural expectation is that
the wheel will rotate in the direction she pushes it—but what happens is quite
different. The forces exerted create a torque that is horizontal toward the
person, as shown in [Figure 3](#fig3)(a). This torque creates a change in
angular momentum $$ \vb{L} $$ in the same direction, perpendicular to the
original angular momentum $$ \vb{L} $$, thus changing the direction of $$ \vb{L}
$$ but not the magnitude of $$ \vb{L} $$. [Figure 3](#fig3)
shows how $$ \Delta \vb{L} $$ and $$ \vb{L} $$ add, giving a new angular
momentum with direction that is inclined more toward the person than before. The
axis of the wheel has thus moved *perpendicular to the forces exerted on it*,
instead of in the expected direction.

![In figure a, a plane is shown. Force F, lying in the same plane, is acting at a point in the plane. At a point, at distant-r from the force, a vertical vector is shown labeled as tau, the torque. In figure b, there is a child on a horse on a merry-go-round. The radius of the merry-go-round is r units. At the foot of the horse, a vector along the plane of merry-go-round is shown. At the centre, the direction of torque tau, angular velocity omega, and angular momentum L are shown as vertical vectors.](../resources/Figure_11_07_02a.jpg "In figure (a), the torque is perpendicular to the plane formed by \( r \) and \( F \) and is the direction your right thumb would point to if you curled your fingers in the direction of \( F \) . Figure (b) shows that the direction of the torque is the same as that of the angular momentum it produces.")

This same logic explains the behavior of gyroscopes. [Figure 4](#fig4) shows the
two forces acting on a spinning gyroscope. The torque produced is perpendicular
to the angular momentum, thus the direction of the torque is changed, but not
its magnitude. The gyroscope *precesses* around a vertical axis, since the
torque is always horizontal and perpendicular to $$ \vb{L} $$. If the gyroscope
is
*not* spinning, it acquires angular momentum in the direction of the torque
( $$ \vb{L}=\Delta \vb{L} $$), and it rotates around a horizontal axis, falling
over just as we would expect.

Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope. Its angular momentum is along its
axis and points at Polaris, the North Star. But Earth is slowly precessing (once
in about 26 000 years) due to the torque of the Sun and the Moon on its
nonspherical shape.

![In figure a, the gyroscope is rotating in counter clockwise direction. The weight of the gyroscope is acting downward. The supportive force is acting at the base. The line of action of the weight and supportive force are different. The torque is acting along the radius of the horizontal circular part of gyroscope. In figure b, the two vectors L and L plus delta L are shown. The vectors start from a point at the bottom of the figure and terminate at two points on a horizontal dotted circle, directed in counter clockwise direction, at the top of the figure. Another vector delta L starts from the head of vector L and terminates at the head of vector L plus delta L.](../resources/Figure_11_07_04a.jpg "As seen in figure (a), the forces on a spinning gyroscope are its weight and the supporting force from the stand. These forces create a horizontal torque on the gyroscope, which create a change in angular momentum \( \Delta  L \) that is also horizontal. In figure (b), \( \Delta L \) and \( L \) add to produce a new angular momentum with the same magnitude, but different direction, so that the gyroscope precesses in the direction shown instead of falling over.")

Rotational kinetic energy is associated with angular momentum? Does that mean that rotational kinetic energy is a vector?

</div>
<div class="solution" data-print-placement="here" markdown="1">
No, energy is always a scalar whether motion is involved or not. No form of energy has a direction in space and you can see that rotational kinetic energy does not depend on the direction of motion just as linear kinetic energy is independent of the direction of motion.

### Section Summary

* Torque is perpendicular to the plane formed by $$ r $$ and $$ \vb{F} $$ and is
  the direction your right thumb would point if you curled the fingers of your
  right hand in the direction of $$ \vb{F} $$. The direction of the torque is
  thus the same as that of the angular momentum it produces.
* The gyroscope precesses around a vertical axis, since the torque is always
  horizontal and perpendicular to $$ \vb{L} $$. If the gyroscope is not
  spinning, it acquires angular momentum in the direction of the torque ( $$
  \vb{L}=\Delta \vb{L} $$), and it rotates about a horizontal axis, falling over
  just as we would expect.
* Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope. Its angular momentum is along its
  axis and points at Polaris, the North Star.

**Integrated Concepts**

The axis of Earth makes a 23.5° angle with a direction perpendicular to the
plane of Earth’s orbit. As shown in [Figure 5](#fig5), this axis precesses,
making one complete rotation in 25 780 y.

(a) Calculate the change in angular momentum in half this time.

(b) What is the average torque producing this change in angular momentum?

(c) If this torque were created by a single force (it is not) acting at the most
effective point on the equator, what would its magnitude be?

![In the figure, the Earth&#x2019;s image is shown. There are two vectors inclined at an angle of twenty three point five degree to the vertical, starting from the centre of the Earth. At the heads of the two vectors there is a circular shape, directed in counter clockwise direction. An angular momentum vector, directed toward left, along its diameter, is shown. The plane of the Earth&#x2019;s orbit is shown as a horizontal line through its center.](../resources/Figure_11_07_06a.jpg "The Earth&#x2019;s axis slowly precesses, always making an angle of 23.5&#xB0; with the direction perpendicular to the plane of Earth&#x2019;s orbit. The change in angular momentum for the two shown positions is quite large, although the magnitude \( L \) is unchanged.")

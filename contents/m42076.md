* Understand and apply a problem-solving procedure to solve problems using Newton\'s laws of motion.

</div>

Success in problem solving is obviously necessary to understand and apply
physical principles, not to mention the more immediate need of passing exams.
The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this text, are followed
here, but specific strategies useful in applying Newton’s laws of motion are
emphasized. These techniques also reinforce concepts that are useful in many
other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated outright in
the worked examples, and so the following techniques should reinforce skills you
have already begun to develop.

### Problem-Solving Strategy for Newton’s Laws of Motion {#import-auto-id2655652}

Step 1. As usual, it is first necessary to identify the physical principles
involved. *Once it is determined that Newton’s laws of motion are involved (if
the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful
sketch of the situation*. Such a sketch is shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1669409)(a). Then, as
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1669409)(b), use arrows to represent all forces,
label them carefully, and make their lengths and directions correspond to the
forces they represent (whenever sufficient information exists).

![(a) A sketch is shown of a man hanging from a vine. (b) The forces acting on the person, shown by vector arrows, are tension T, pointing upward at the hand of the man, F sub T, from the same point but in a downward direction, and weight W, acting downward from his stomach. (c) In figure (c) we define only the man as the system of interest. Tension T is acting upward from his hand. The weight W acts in a downward direction. In a free-body diagram W is shown by an arrow acting downward and T is shown by an arrow acting vertically upward. (d) Tension T is shown by an arrow vertically upward and another vector, weight W, is shown by an arrow vertically downward, both having the same lengths. It is indicated that T is equal to minus W.](../resources/Figure 04_06_01.jpg "(a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces. T size 12{T} {} is the tension in the vine above Tarzan, FT size 12{F rSub { size 8{T} } } {} is the force he exerts on the vine, and w size 12{w} {} is his weight. All other forces, such as the nudge of a breeze, are assumed negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the ape man&#x2019;s mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We then define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram. FT size 12{F rSub { size 8{T} } } {} is no longer shown, because it is not a force acting on the system of interest; rather, FT size 12{F rSub { size 8{T} } } {} acts on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail method of addition is used. It is apparent that T=-w size 12{T=w} {}, if Tarzan is stationary.")
{: #import-auto-id1669409}

Step 2. Identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be
inferred from the problem as stated. That is, make a list of knowns and
unknowns. *Then carefully determine the system of interest*. This decision is a
crucial step, since Newton’s second law involves only external forces. Once the
system of interest has been identified, it becomes possible to determine which
forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newton’s
second law. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1669409)(c).) Newton’s third law may
be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (
internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated
earlier in this chapter, the system of interest depends on what question we need
to answer. This choice becomes easier with practice, eventually developing into
an almost unconscious process. Skill in clearly defining systems will be
beneficial in later chapters as well. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

A diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is
called a **free-body diagram**{: data-type="
term" #import-auto-id1606094}. Only forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not
acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several of these in worked
examples. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1669409)(c) shows a free-body diagram for
the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body
diagram.

Step 3. Once a free-body diagram is drawn, *Newton’s second law can be applied
to solve the problem*. This is done in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1669409)(d) for
a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified
in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into
equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If
the problem is one-dimensional—that is, if all forces are parallel—then they add
like scalars. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down
into a pair of one-dimensional problems. This is done by projecting the force
vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples,
the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is
involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and one
perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make
one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known.

Applying Newton’s Second Law
</div>
Before you write net force equations, it is critical to determine whether the system is accelerating in a particular direction. If the acceleration is zero in a particular direction, then the net force is zero in that direction. Similarly, if the acceleration is nonzero in a particular direction, then the net force is described by the equation:  $$ {F}_{\text{net}}=\text{ma} $$ 

.

For example, if the system is accelerating in the horizontal direction, but it
is not accelerating in the vertical direction, then you will have the following
conclusions:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-id1449134">
 $$ {F}_{\text{net}x}=\text{ma}, $$ 
</div>
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-id1478667">
 $$ {F}_{\text{net}y}=0. $$ 
</div>
You will need this information in order to determine unknown forces acting in a system.

</div>

Step 4. As always, *check the solution to see whether it is reasonable*. In some
cases, this is obvious. For example, it is reasonable to find that friction
causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction
exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving, and
with experience it becomes progressively easier to judge whether an answer is
reasonable. Another way to check your solution is to check the units. If you are
solving for force and end up with units of m/s, then you have made a mistake.

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1655645} To solve problems involving Newton’s laws of
  motion, follow the procedure described:
    1. {: #import-auto-id1435944} Draw a sketch of the problem.
    2. {: #import-auto-id1304011} Identify known and unknown quantities, and
       identify the system of interest. Draw a free-body diagram, which is a
       sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object. The object is
       represented by a dot, and the forces are represented by vectors extending
       in different directions from the dot. If vectors act in directions that
       are not horizontal or vertical, resolve the vectors into horizontal and
       vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram.
    3. {: #import-auto-id2638784} Write Newton’s second law in the horizontal
       and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the
       object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the
       $$ x $$
       -direction) then $$ {F}_{\text{net}x}=0 $$
       . If the object does accelerate in that direction, $$ {F}_
       {\text{net}x}=\text{ma} $$
       .
    4. {: #import-auto-id2664631} Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable?
       Are the units correct? {: type="1"}

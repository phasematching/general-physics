The discovery and study of nuclear radioactivity quickly revealed evidence of
revolutionary new physics. In addition, uses for nuclear radiation also emerged
quickly—for example, people such as Ernest Rutherford used it to determine the
size of the nucleus and devices were painted with radon-doped paint to make them
glow in the dark (see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). We therefore begin our study of
nuclear physics with the discovery and basic features of nuclear radioactivity.

It is a poignant reminder of the dual nature of radiation. Although radium paint dials are conveniently visible day and night, they emit radon, a radioactive gas that is hazardous and is not directly sensed. (credit: U.S. Air Force Photo)")

### Discovery of Nuclear Radioactivity

In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) accidentally
found that a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende emits invisible,
penetrating rays that can darken a photographic plate enclosed in an opaque
envelope. The rays therefore carry energy; but amazingly, the pitchblende emits
them continuously without any energy input. This is an apparent violation of the
law of conservation of energy, one that we now understand is due to the
conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as related in Einstein’s
famous equation $$E=mc^{2} $$ . It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays
originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. The
emission of these rays is called **nuclear radioactivity** or simply **
radioactivity**{: class="term"}. The rays themselves are called **nuclear
radiation**{: class="term"}. A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its
mass to emit radiation is said to **decay**{: class="term"} (a term also used to
describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states). A substance or
object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be **radioactive**{: class="term"
}.

Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel’s rays originate deep in
the heart (or nucleus) of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be
associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Radiation does not vary with
chemical state—that is, uranium is radioactive whether it is in the form of an
element or compound. In addition, radiation does not vary with temperature,
pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of these factors
affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron
transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is
the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear
radiation has energies of the order of $$10^{6} \text{eV} $$ per event, which is
much greater than the typical atomic energies (a few $$\text{eV} $$ ), such as
that observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high
as the most energetic characteristic x rays. Becquerel did not vigorously pursue
his discovery for very long. In 1898, Marie Curie (1867–1934), then a graduate
student married the already well-known French physicist Pierre Curie (1859–1906)
, began her doctoral study of Becquerel’s rays. She and her husband soon
discovered two new radioactive elements, which she named **polonium** (after her
native land) and **radium** (because it radiates). These two new elements filled
holes in the periodic table and, further, displayed much higher levels of
radioactivity per gram of material than uranium. Over a period of four years,
working under poor conditions and spending their own funds, the Curies processed
more than a ton of uranium ore to isolate a gram of radium salt. Radium became
highly sought after, because it was about two million times as radioactive as
uranium. Curie’s radium salt glowed visibly from the radiation that took its
toll on them and other unaware researchers. Shortly after completing her Ph.D.,
both Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for their work
on radioactivity. Pierre was killed in a horse cart accident in 1906, but Marie
continued her study of radioactivity for nearly 30 more years. Awarded the 1911
Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of two new elements, she remains the
only person to win Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Marie’s radioactive
fingerprints on some pages of her notebooks can still expose film, and she
suffered from radiation-induced lesions. She died of leukemia likely caused by
radiation, but she was active in research almost until her death in 1934. The
following year, her daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie,
were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificially
induced radiation, adding to a remarkable family legacy.

### Alpha, Beta, and Gamma

Research begun by people such as New Zealander Ernest Rutherford soon after the
discovery of nuclear radiation indicated that different types of rays are
emitted. Eventually, three types were distinguished and named **alpha** $$\left(
\alpha \right) $$ ,
**beta** $$\left(\beta \right) $$ , and **gamma** $$\left(\gamma \right) $$ ,
because, like x-rays, their identities were initially
unknown. [[Figure 2]](#Figure2) shows what happens if the rays are passed
through a magnetic field. The $$\gamma $$ s are unaffected, while the $$\alpha
$$ s and $$\beta $$ s are deflected in opposite directions, indicating the
$$\alpha $$ s are positive, the $$\beta $$ s negative, and the $$\gamma $$ s
uncharged. Rutherford used both magnetic and electric fields to show that
$$\alpha $$ s have a positive charge twice the magnitude of an electron, or
$$+2\mid {q}_{e}\mid $$ . In the process, he found the $$\alpha $$ s charge to
mass ratio to be several thousand times smaller than the electron’s. Later on,
Rutherford collected $$\alpha $$ s from a radioactive source and passed an
electric discharge through them, obtaining the spectrum of recently discovered
helium gas. Among many important discoveries made by Rutherford and his
collaborators was the proof that $$\alpha $$
*radiation is the emission of a helium nucleus*. Rutherford won the Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1908 for his early work. He continued to make important
contributions until his death in 1934.

![The figure shows north and south poles of a magnet through which three rays labeled as alpha beta and gamma are passed. After passing through a magnetic field the alpha ray is slightly deflected toward the right. The beta ray is deflected toward the left and the gamma ray is not deflected.](../resources/Figure_32_01_02a.jpg "Alpha, beta, and gamma rays are passed through a magnetic field on the way to a phosphorescent screen. The \(\alpha\)s and \( \beta \)s bend in opposite directions, while the \( \gamma \)s are unaffected, indicating a positive charge for \( \alpha \)s, negative for \( \beta \)s, and neutral for \( \gamma \)s. Consistent results are obtained with electric fields. Collection of the radiation offers further confirmation from the direct measurement of excess charge.")
{: #Figure2}

Other researchers had already proved that $$\beta $$ s are negative and have the
same mass and same charge-to-mass ratio as the recently discovered electron. By
1902, it was recognized that $$\beta $$
*radiation is the emission of an electron*. Although $$\beta $$ s are electrons,
they do not exist in the nucleus before it decays and are not ejected atomic
electrons—the electron is created in the nucleus at the instant of decay.

Since $$\gamma $$ s remain unaffected by electric and magnetic fields, it is
natural to think they might be photons. Evidence for this grew, but it was not
until 1914 that this was proved by Rutherford and collaborators. By scattering
$$\gamma $$ radiation from a crystal and observing interference, they
demonstrated that $$\gamma $$
*radiation is the emission of a high-energy photon by a nucleus*. In fact,
$$\gamma $$ radiation comes from the de-excitation of a nucleus, just as an x
ray comes from the de-excitation of an atom. The names \" $$\gamma $$ ray\" and
\"x ray\" identify the source of the radiation. At the same energy, $$\gamma $$
rays and x rays are otherwise identical.

### Ionization and Range

Two of the most important characteristics of $$\alpha $$ , $$\beta $$ , and
$$\gamma $$ rays were recognized very early. All three types of nuclear
radiation produce **ionization** in materials, but they penetrate different
distances in materials—that is, they have different **ranges**. Let us examine
why they have these characteristics and what are some of the consequences.

Like x rays, nuclear radiation in the form of $$\alpha $$ s, $$\beta $$ s, and
$$\gamma $$ s has enough energy per event to ionize atoms and molecules in any
material. The energy emitted in various nuclear decays ranges from a few
$$\text{keV} $$ to more than $$10 \text{MeV} $$ , while only a few $$\text{eV}
$$ are needed to produce ionization. The effects of x rays and nuclear radiation
on biological tissues and other materials, such as solid state electronics, are
directly related to the ionization they produce. All of them, for example, can
damage electronics or kill cancer cells. In addition, methods for detecting x
rays and nuclear radiation are based on ionization, directly or indirectly. All
of them can ionize the air between the plates of a capacitor, for example,
causing it to discharge. This is the basis of inexpensive personal radiation
monitors, such as pictured in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Apart from $$\alpha $$ ,
$$\beta $$ , and $$\gamma $$ , there are other forms of nuclear radiation as
well, and these also produce ionization with similar effects. We define **
ionizing radiation** as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether
nuclear in origin or not, since the effects and detection of the radiation are
related to ionization.

![Image shows a person&#x2019;s hand holding a cylindrical object placed near a small piece of radioactive material. A dial indicator is connected to the cylindrical radiation detector.](../resources/Figure_32_01_03a.jpg "These dosimeters (literally, dose meters) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor. The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered, a measurement of dose. One dosimeter is shown in the charger. Its scale is read through an eyepiece on the top.

{: #Figure3}

The **range of radiation** is defined to be the distance it can travel through a
material. Range is related to several factors, including the energy of the
radiation, the material encountered, and the type of radiation (
see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). The higher the **energy**, the greater the range,
all other factors being the same. This makes good sense, since radiation loses
its energy in materials primarily by producing ionization in them, and each
ionization of an atom or a molecule requires energy that is removed from the
radiation. The amount of ionization is, thus, directly proportional to the
energy of the particle of radiation, as is its range.

![Three cases of range of radiation are shown. The first case shows that higher energy has greater range than lower energy. The second case shows that, for same energy material having high electron density will have lower range. The third case shows that among alpha beta and gamma rays for the same energy alphas have the smallest range betas have a greater range and gammas penetrate the farthest.](../resources/Figure_32_01_04a.jpg "The penetration or range of radiation depends on its energy, the material it encounters, and the type of radiation. (a) Greater energy means greater range. (b) Radiation has a smaller range in materials with high electron density. (c) Alphas have the smallest range, betas have a greater range, and gammas penetrate the farthest.")
{: #Figure4}

Radiation can be absorbed or shielded by materials, such as the lead aprons
dentists drape on us when taking x rays. Lead is a particularly effective shield
compared with other materials, such as plastic or air. How does the range of
radiation depend on **material**? Ionizing radiation interacts best with charged
particles in a material. Since electrons have small masses, they most readily
absorb the energy of the radiation in collisions. The greater the density of a
material and, in particular, the greater the density of electrons within a
material, the smaller the range of radiation.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Collisions
</div>
Conservation of energy and momentum often results in energy transfer to a less massive object in a collision. This was discussed in detail in [Work, Energy, and Energy Resources](/m42145), for example.

</div>

Different **types** of radiation have different ranges when compared at the same
energy and in the same material. Alphas have the shortest range, betas penetrate
farther, and gammas have the greatest range. This is directly related to charge
and speed of the particle or type of radiation. At a given energy, each $$\alpha
$$ , $$\beta $$ , or $$\gamma $$ will produce the same number of ionizations in
a material (each ionization requires a certain amount of energy on average). The
more readily the particle produces ionization, the more quickly it will lose its
energy. The effect of **charge** is as follows: The $$\alpha $$ has a charge of
$$+{2q}_{e} $$ , the $$\beta $$ has a charge of $$-{q}_{e} $$ , and the $$\gamma
$$ is uncharged. The electromagnetic force exerted by the $$\alpha $$ is thus
twice as strong as that exerted by the $$\beta $$ and it is more likely to
produce ionization. Although chargeless, the $$\gamma $$ does interact weakly
because it is an electromagnetic wave, but it is less likely to produce
ionization in any encounter. More quantitatively, the change in momentum
$$\Delta p $$ given to a particle in the material is $$\Delta p=F\Delta t $$ ,
where $$F $$ is the force the $$\alpha $$ , $$\beta $$ , or $$\gamma $$ exerts
over a time $$\Delta t $$ . The smaller the charge, the smaller is $$F $$ and
the smaller is the momentum (and energy) lost. Since the speed of alphas is
about 5% to 10% of the speed of light, classical (non-relativistic) formulas
apply.

The **speed** at which they travel is the other major factor affecting the range
of $$\alpha $$ s, $$\beta $$ s, and $$\gamma $$ s. The faster they move, the
less time they spend in the vicinity of an atom or a molecule, and the less
likely they are to interact. Since $$\alpha $$ s and $$\beta $$ s are particles
with mass (helium nuclei and electrons, respectively), their energy is kinetic,
given classically by $$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ . The mass of the $$\beta $$
particle is thousands of times less than that of the $$\alpha $$ s, so that
$$\beta $$ s must travel much faster than $$\alpha $$ s to have the same energy.
Since $$\beta $$ s move faster (most at relativistic speeds), they have less
time to interact than $$\alpha $$ s. Gamma rays are photons, which must travel
at the speed of light. They are even less likely to interact than a $$\beta $$ ,
since they spend even less time near a given atom (and they have no charge). The
range of $$\gamma $$ s is thus greater than the range of $$\beta$$s.

Alpha radiation from radioactive sources has a range much less than a millimeter
of biological tissues, usually not enough to even penetrate the dead layers of
our skin. On the other hand, the same $$\alpha $$ radiation can penetrate a few
centimeters of air, so mere distance from a source prevents $$\alpha $$
radiation from reaching us. This makes $$\alpha $$ radiation relatively safe for
our body compared to $$\beta $$ and $$\gamma $$ radiation. Typical $$\beta $$
radiation can penetrate a few millimeters of tissue or about a meter of air.
Beta radiation is thus hazardous even when not ingested. The range of $$\beta $$
s in lead is about a millimeter, and so it is easy to store $$\beta $$ sources
in lead radiation-proof containers. Gamma rays have a much greater range than
either $$\alpha $$ s or $$\beta $$ s. In fact, if a given thickness of material,
like a lead brick, absorbs 90% of the $$\gamma $$ s, then a second lead brick
will only absorb 90% of what got through the first. Thus, $$\gamma $$ s do not
have a well-defined range; we can only cut down the amount that gets through.
Typically, $$\gamma $$ s can penetrate many meters of air, go right through our
bodies, and are effectively shielded (that is, reduced in intensity to
acceptable levels) by many centimeters of lead. One benefit of $$\gamma $$ s is
that they can be used as radioactive tracers (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

Different parts of the body show bright spots wherever the bone cells are most active, indicating bone cancer.](../resources/Figure_32_01_05a.jpg "This image of the concentration of a radioactive tracer in a patient&#x2019;s body reveals where the most active bone cells are, an indication of bone cancer.

The emitted \( \gamma \) radiation has a sufficient range to leave the body&#x2014;the range of \( \alpha \)s and \( \beta \)s is too small for them to be observed outside the patient.

### Section Summary

* Some nuclei are radioactive—they spontaneously decay destroying some part of
  their mass and emitting energetic rays, a process called nuclear
  radioactivity.
* Nuclear radiation, like x rays, is ionizing radiation, because energy
  sufficient to ionize matter is emitted in each decay.
* The range (or distance traveled in a material) of ionizing radiation is
  directly related to the charge of the emitted particle and its energy, with
  greater-charge and lower-energy particles having the shortest ranges.
* Radiation detectors are based directly or indirectly upon the ionization
  created by radiation, as are the effects of radiation on living and inert
  materials.

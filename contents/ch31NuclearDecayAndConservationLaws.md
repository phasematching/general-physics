Nuclear **decay**{: class="term"} has provided an amazing window into the realm
of the very small. Nuclear decay gave the first indication of the connection
between mass and energy, and it revealed the existence of two of the four basic
forces in nature. In this section, we explore the major modes of nuclear decay;
and, like those who first explored them, we will discover evidence of previously
unknown particles and conservation laws.

Some nuclides are stable, apparently living forever. Unstable nuclides decay (
that is, they are radioactive), eventually producing a stable nuclide after many
decays. We call the original nuclide the **parent** and its decay products
the **daughters**. Some radioactive nuclides decay in a single step to a stable
nucleus. For example, $${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ is unstable and decays directly to
$${}^{60}\text{Ni} $$ , which is stable. Others, such as $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ ,
decay to another unstable nuclide, resulting in a **decay series** in which each
subsequent nuclide decays until a stable nuclide is finally produced. The decay
series that starts from $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ is of particular interest, since
it produces the radioactive isotopes $${}^{226}\text{Ra} $$ and
$${}^{210}\text{Po} $$ , which the Curies first discovered (
see [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Radon gas is also produced ( $${}^{222}\text{Rn} $$
in the series), an increasingly recognized naturally occurring hazard. Since
radon is a noble gas, it emanates from materials, such as soil, containing even
trace amounts of $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ and can be inhaled. The decay of radon
and its daughters produces internal damage. The $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ decay
series ends with $${}^{206}\text{Pb} $$ , a stable isotope of lead.

![A graph is shown in which decay of alpha and beta is shown. Also half lives of each isotope are shown. Uranium decays in one mode but some isotopes decay by more than one mode. Finally a stable isotope of lead results.](../resources/Figure_32_04_01a.jpg "The decay series produced by \( {}^{238}\text{U} \), the most common uranium isotope. Nuclides are graphed in the same manner as in the chart of nuclides. The type of decay for each member of the series is shown, as well as the half-lives. Note that some nuclides decay by more than one mode. You can see why radium and polonium are found in uranium ore. A stable isotope of lead is the end product of the series.")
{: #Figure1}

Note that the daughters of $$\alpha $$ decay shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)
always have two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the parent. This seems
reasonable, since we know that $$\alpha $$ decay is the emission of a
$${}^{4}\text{He} $$ nucleus, which has two protons and two neutrons. The
daughters of $$\beta $$ decay have one less neutron and one more proton than
their parent. Beta decay is a little more subtle, as we shall see. No $$\gamma
$$ decays are shown in the figure, because they do not produce a daughter that
differs from the parent.

### Alpha Decay

In **alpha decay**{: class="term"}, a $${}^{4}\text{He} $$ nucleus simply breaks
away from the parent nucleus, leaving a daughter with two fewer protons and two
fewer neutrons than the parent (see [[Figure 2]](#Figure2)). One example of
$$\alpha $$ decay is shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) for $${}^{238}\text{U} $$ .
Another nuclide that undergoes $$\alpha $$ decay is <span> $${}^{239}\text{Pu}
$$ .
</span> The decay equations for these two nuclides are

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{238}\text{U} \to {}^{234}{\text{Th}}_{92}^{234}+{}^{4}\text{He} $$
</div>

and

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{239}\text{Pu} \to {}^{235}\text{U}+{}^{4}\text{He}. $$
</div>

![The image shows conditions before and after alpha decay. Before alpha decay the nucleus is labeled parent and after decay the nucleus is labeled daughter.](../resources/Figure_32_04_02a.jpg "Alpha decay is the separation of a \( {}^4\text{He} \) nucleus from the parent. The daughter nucleus has two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the parent. Alpha decay occurs spontaneously only if the daughter and \( {}^4\text{He}\) nucleus have less total mass than the parent.")
{: #Figure2}

If you examine the periodic table of the elements, you will find that Th has
$$Z=90 $$ , two fewer than U, which has $$Z=92 $$ . Similarly, in the second **decay equation**{: class="term"}, we see that U has two fewer protons than Pu,
which has $$Z=94 $$ . The general rule for $$\alpha $$ decay is best written in
the format $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N} $$ . If a certain nuclide is known to
$$\alpha $$ decay (generally this information must be looked up in a table of
isotopes, such as in [Appendix B](../contents/m42702)), its $$\alpha $$
**decay equation** is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}\to {}_{Z-2}^{A-4}{\text{Y}}_{N-2}+{}_{2}^{4}{\text{He}}_{2}   \left(\alpha  \text{decay}\right) $$
</div>

where Y is the nuclide that has two fewer protons than X, such as Th having two
fewer than U. So if you were told that $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ $$\alpha $$ decays
and were asked to write the complete decay equation, you would first look up
which element has two fewer protons (an atomic number two lower) and find that
this is uranium. Then since four nucleons have broken away from the original
239, its atomic mass would be 235.

It is instructive to examine conservation laws related to $$\alpha $$ decay. You
can see from the equation $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}\to {}_
{Z-2}^{A-4}{\text{Y}}_{N-2}+{}_{2}^{4}{\text{He}}_{2} $$ that total charge is
conserved. Linear and angular momentum are conserved, too. Although conserved
angular momentum is not of great consequence in this type of decay, conservation
of linear momentum has interesting consequences. If the nucleus is at rest when
it decays, its momentum is zero. In that case, the fragments must fly in
opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta so that total momentum remains
zero. This results in the $$\alpha $$
** particle carrying away most of the energy, as a bullet from a heavy rifle
carries away most of the energy of the powder burned to shoot it. Total
mass–energy is also conserved: the energy produced in the decay comes from
conversion of a fraction of the original mass. As discussed
in [Atomic Physics](../contents/ch30AtomicPhysics), the general relationship is

<div class="equation" >
 $$E =\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2}. $$
</div>

Here, $$E $$ is the **nuclear reaction energy** (the reaction can be nuclear
decay or any other reaction), and $$\Delta m $$ is the difference in mass
between initial and final products. When the final products have less total
mass, $$\Delta m $$ is positive, and the reaction releases energy (is
exothermic). When the products have greater total mass, the reaction is
endothermic ( $$\Delta m $$ is negative) and must be induced with an energy
input. For $$\alpha $$ decay to be spontaneous, the decay products must have
smaller mass than the parent.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Alpha Decay Energy Found from Nuclear Masses
</div>
Find the energy emitted in the  $$\alpha  $$
 decay of  $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$.

**Strategy**

Nuclear reaction energy, such as released in *α* decay, can be found using the
equation $$E=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2} $$ . We must first find $$\Delta m $$
, the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the
decay. This is easily done using masses given in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699).

**Solution**

The decay equation was given earlier for $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ ; it is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{239}\text{Pu}\to {}^{235}\text{U}+{}^{4}\text{He}. $$
</div>
Thus the pertinent masses are those of  $${}^{239}\text{Pu} $$ ,
  $${}^{235}\text{U} $$ ,
 and the  $$\alpha  $$
 particle or  $${}^{4}\text{He} $$ ,
 all of which are listed in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699). The initial mass was  $$m \left({}^{239}\text{Pu}\right)=239.052157 \text{u} $$ .
 The final mass is the sum  $$m\left( {}^{235}\text{U}\right)+ m \left({}^{4}\text{He}\right)= 235.043924 \text{u} + 4.002602 \text{u} = 239.046526 \text{u} $$ .
 Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta m& =& m\left({}^{239}\text{Pu}\right)-\left[m\left({}^{235}\text{U}\right)+m\left({}^{4}\text{He}\right)\right]\\ & =&  239.052157 \text{u}-239.046526 \text{u}\\ & =& 0.0005631 \text{u} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
Now we can find  $$E $$
 by entering  $$\Delta m $$
 into the equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2}=\left(0.005631\text{ u}\right){c}^{2}. $$
</div>
We know  $$1 \text{u}=931.5 \text{MeV/}{c}^{2} $$ ,
 and so

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left(0.005631\right)\left(931.5 \text{MeV}/{c}^{2}\right)\left({c}^{2}\right)=5.25 \text{MeV}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

The energy released in this $$\alpha $$ decay is in the $$\text{MeV} $$ range,
about $$10^{6} $$ times as great as typical chemical reaction energies,
consistent with many previous discussions. Most of this energy becomes kinetic
energy of the $$\alpha $$ particle (or $${}^{4}\text{He} $$ nucleus), which
moves away at high speed. The energy carried away by the recoil of the
$${}^{235}\text{U} $$ nucleus is much smaller in order to conserve momentum. The
$${}^{235}\text{U} $$ nucleus can be left in an excited state to later emit
photons ( $$\gamma $$ rays). This decay is spontaneous and releases energy,
because the products have less mass than the parent nucleus. The question of why
the products have less mass will be discussed in [Binding Energy](../contents/ch31BindingEnergy). Note
that the masses given in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699) are atomic masses of neutral
atoms, including their electrons. The mass of the electrons is the same before
and after $$\alpha $$ decay, and so their masses subtract out when finding
$$\Delta m $$ . In this case, there are 94 electrons before and after the decay.

</div>

### Beta Decay

There are actually *three* types of **beta decay**{: class="term"}. The first
discovered was “ordinary” beta decay and is called $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay or
electron emission. The symbol $${\beta }^{-} $$ represents *an electron emitted
in nuclear beta decay*. Cobalt-60 is a nuclide that $${\beta }^{-} $$ decays in
the following manner:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{60}\text{Co}\to {}^{60}\text{Ni}+{\beta }^{-}+\text{neutrino} \text{.}  $$
</div>

The **neutrino** is a particle emitted in beta decay that was unanticipated and
is of fundamental importance. The neutrino was not even proposed in theory until
more than 20 years after beta decay was known to involve electron emissions.
Neutrinos are so difficult to detect that the first direct evidence of them was
not obtained until 1953. Neutrinos are nearly massless, have no charge, and do
not interact with nucleons via the strong nuclear force. Traveling approximately
at the speed of light, they have little time to affect any nucleus they
encounter. This is, owing to the fact that they have no charge (and they are not
EM waves), they do not interact through the EM force. They do interact via the
relatively weak and very short range weak nuclear force. Consequently, neutrinos
escape almost any detector and penetrate almost any shielding. However,
neutrinos do carry energy, angular momentum (they are fermions with
half-integral spin), and linear momentum away from a beta decay. When accurate
measurements of beta decay were made, it became apparent that energy, angular
momentum, and linear momentum were not accounted for by the daughter nucleus and
electron alone. Either a previously unsuspected particle was carrying them away,
or three conservation laws were being violated. Wolfgang Pauli made a formal
proposal for the existence of neutrinos in 1930. The Italian-born American
physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) gave neutrinos their name, meaning little
neutral ones, when he developed a sophisticated theory of beta decay (
see [[Figure 3]](#Figure3)). Part of Fermi’s theory was the identification of
the weak nuclear force as being distinct from the strong nuclear force and in
fact responsible for beta decay.

![Photo of physicist Enrico Fermi.](../resources/Figure_32_04_03a.jpg "Enrico Fermi was nearly unique among 20th-century physicists&#x2014;he made significant contributions both as an experimentalist and a theorist. His many contributions to theoretical physics included the identification of the weak nuclear force. The fermi (fm) is named after him, as are an entire class of subatomic particles (fermions), an element (Fermium), and a major research laboratory (Fermilab). His experimental work included studies of radioactivity, for which he won the 1938 Nobel Prize in physics, and creation of the first nuclear chain reaction.

{: #Figure3}

The neutrino also reveals a new conservation law. There are various families of
particles, one of which is the electron family. We propose that the number of
members of the electron family is constant in any process or any closed system.
In our example of beta decay, there are no members of the electron family
present before the decay, but after, there is an electron and a neutrino. So
electrons are given an electron family number of $$+1 $$ . The neutrino in
$${\beta }^{-} $$ decay is an **electron’s antineutrino**, given the symbol
$${\overline{\nu }}_{e} $$ , where $$\nu $$ is the Greek letter nu, and the
subscript *e* means this neutrino is related to the electron. The bar indicates
this is a particle of **antimatter**. (All particles have antimatter
counterparts that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite
charge. Antimatter is almost entirely absent on Earth, but it is found in
nuclear decay and other nuclear and particle reactions as well as in outer
space.) The electron’s antineutrino $${\overline{\nu }}_{e} $$ , being
antimatter, has an electron family number of $$-1 $$ . The total is zero, before
and after the decay. The new conservation law, obeyed in all circumstances,
states that the *total electron family number is constant*. An electron cannot
be created without also creating an antimatter family member. This law is
analogous to the conservation of charge in a situation where total charge is
originally zero, and equal amounts of positive and negative charge must be
created in a reaction to keep the total zero.

If a nuclide $${}_{Z}^{A}{X}_{N} $$ is known to $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay, then
its $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay equation is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{Z}{}^{A} {\text{X}}_{N}\to {}_{Z+1}{}^{A} {\text{Y}}_{N-1}+{\beta }^{-}+{\stackrel{-}{\nu }}_{e} \left({\beta }^{-} \text{decay}\right), $$
</div>

where Y is the nuclide having one more proton than X (
see [[Figure 4]](#Figure4)). So if you know that a certain nuclide $${\beta
}^{-} $$ decays, you can find the daughter nucleus by first looking up $$Z $$
for the parent and then determining which element has atomic number $$Z+1 $$ .
In the example of the $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay of $${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ given
earlier, we see that $$Z=27 $$ for Co and $$Z=28 $$ is Ni. It is as if one of
the neutrons in the parent nucleus decays into a proton, electron, and neutrino.
In fact, neutrons outside of nuclei do just that—they live only an average of a
few minutes and $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay in the following manner:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{n}\to \text{p}+{\beta }^{-}+{\stackrel{-}{\nu }}_{e}. $$
</div>

![Image shows parent nucleus before beta decay and daughter nucleus after beta decay.](../resources/Figure_32_04_04a.jpg "In \( \beta^{-} \) decay, the parent nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino. The daughter nucleus has one more proton and one less neutron than its parent. Neutrinos interact so weakly that they are almost never directly observed, but they play a fundamental role in particle physics.")
{: #Figure4}

We see that charge is conserved in $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay, since the total
charge is $$Z $$ before and after the decay. For example, in $${}^{60}\text{Co}
$$ decay, total charge is 27 before decay, since cobalt has $$Z=27 $$ . After
decay, the daughter nucleus is Ni, which has $$Z=28 $$ , and there is an
electron, so that the total charge is also $$28 + \left(-1\right) $$ or 27.
Angular momentum is conserved, but not obviously (you have to examine the spins
and angular momenta of the final products in detail to verify this). Linear
momentum is also conserved, again imparting most of the decay energy to the
electron and the antineutrino, since they are of low and zero mass,
respectively. Another new conservation law is obeyed here and elsewhere in
nature. *The total number of nucleons $$A $$ is conserved*. In
$${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ decay, for example, there are 60 nucleons before and after
the decay. Note that total $$A $$ is also conserved in $$\alpha $$ decay. Also
note that the total number of protons changes, as does the total number of
neutrons, so that total $$Z $$ and total $$N $$ are *not* conserved in $${\beta
}^{-} $$ decay, as they are in $$\alpha $$ decay. Energy released in $${\beta
}^{-} $$ decay can be calculated given the masses of the parent and products.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
 $${\beta }^{-} $$ Decay Energy from Masses
</div>
Find the energy emitted in the  $${\beta }^{-} $$
 decay of  $${}^{60}\text{Co} $$.

**Strategy and Concept**

As in the preceding example, we must first find $$\Delta m $$ , the difference
in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay, using masses
given in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699). Then the emitted energy is calculated as before,
using $$E=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2} $$ . The initial mass is just that of the
parent nucleus, and the final mass is that of the daughter nucleus and the
electron created in the decay. The neutrino is massless, or nearly so. However,
since the masses given in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699) are for neutral atoms, the
daughter nucleus has one more electron than the parent, and so the extra
electron mass that corresponds to the $${\beta }^{-} $$ is included in the
atomic mass of Ni. Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta m=m\left({}^{60}\text{Co}\right)-m\left({}^{60}\text{Ni}\right). $$
</div>
**Solution**

The $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay equation for $${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{27}^{60}{\text{Co}}_{33}\to {}_{28}^{60}{\text{Ni}}_{32}+{\beta }^{-}+{\overline{\nu }}_{e}. $$
</div>
As noticed,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta m=m\left({}^{60}\text{Co}\right)-m\left({}^{60}\text{Ni}\right). $$
</div>
Entering the masses found in [Appendix A](../contents/m42699) gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta m=59.933820 \text{u}-59.930789 \text{u}=0.003031 \text{u}. $$
</div>
Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2}=\left(0.003031 \text{u}\right){c}^{2}. $$
</div>
Using  $$1 u=931.5 MeV/{c}^{2} $$ ,
 we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\left(0.003031\right)\left(931.5 MeV/{c}^{2}\right)\left({c}^{2}\right)=2.82 \text{MeV} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion and Implications**

Perhaps the most difficult thing about this example is convincing yourself that
the $${\beta }^{-} $$ mass is included in the atomic mass of $${}^{60}\text{Ni}
$$ . Beyond that are other implications. Again the decay energy is in the MeV
range. This energy is shared by all of the products of the decay. In many
$${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ decays, the daughter nucleus $${}^{60}\text{Ni} $$ is left
in an excited state and emits photons (  $$\gamma $$ rays). Most of the
remaining energy goes to the electron and neutrino, since the recoil kinetic
energy of the daughter nucleus is small. One final note: the electron emitted in
$${\beta }^{-} $$ decay is created in the nucleus at the time of decay.

</div>

The second type of beta decay is less common than the first. It is $${\beta
}^{+} $$ decay. Certain nuclides decay by the emission of a *positive* electron.
This is **antielectron** or **positron decay** (see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

![Image shows parent nucleus before beta plus decay and daughter nucleus after beta plus decay, which results in a positively charged electron called a positron.](../resources/Figure_32_04_05a.jpg " \( \beta^{+} \) decay is the emission of a positron that eventually finds an electron to annihilate, characteristically producing gammas in opposite directions.")
{: #Figure5}

The antielectron is often represented by the symbol $${e}^{+} $$ , but in beta
decay it is written as $${\beta }^{+} $$ to indicate the antielectron was
emitted in a nuclear decay. Antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to
electrons, being nearly identical, having the same mass, spin, and so on, but
having a positive charge and an electron family number of $$-1 $$ . When a **positron**{: class="term"} encounters an electron, there is a mutual
annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectron-electron pair is
converted into pure photon energy. (The reaction, $${e}^{+}+{e}^{-}\to \gamma
+\gamma $$ , conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved
quantities.) If a nuclide $${}_{Z}^{A}{X}_{N} $$ is known to $${\beta }^{+} $$
decay, then its $${\beta }^{+} $$
**decay equation** is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}\to {}_{Z-1}{}^{A} {\text{Y}}_{N+1}+{\beta }^{+}+{\nu }_{e} \left({\beta }^{+} \text{decay}\right), $$
</div>

where Y is the nuclide having one less proton than X (to conserve charge) and
$${\nu }_{e} $$ is the symbol for the **electron’s neutrino**, which has an
electron family number of $$+1 $$ . Since an antimatter member of the electron
family (the $${\beta }^{+} $$ )
is created in the decay, a matter member of the family (here the $${\nu }_{e}
$$ )
must also be created. Given, for example, that $${}^{22}\text{Na} $$ $${\beta
}^{+} $$ decays, you can write its full decay equation by first finding that
$$Z=11 $$ for $${}^{22}\text{Na} $$ , so that the daughter nuclide will have
$$Z=10 $$ , the atomic number for neon. Thus the $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay
equation for $${}^{22}\text{Na} $$ is

<div class="equation" >
 $${}_{11}^{22}{\text{Na}}_{11}\to {}_10^{22}{\text{Ne}}_{12}+{\beta }^{+}+{\nu }_{e}. $$
</div>

In $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay, it is as if one of the protons in the parent nucleus
decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. Protons do not do this
outside of the nucleus, and so the decay is due to the complexities of the
nuclear force. Note again that the total number of nucleons is constant in this
and any other reaction. To find the energy emitted in $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay,
you must again count the number of electrons in the neutral atoms, since atomic
masses are used. The daughter has one less electron than the parent, and one
electron mass is created in the decay. Thus, in $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta m=m\left(\text{parent}\right)-\left[ m\left(\text{daughter}\right)+{2m}_{e}\right]  , $$
</div>

since we use the masses of neutral atoms.

**Electron capture**{: class="term"} is the third type of beta decay. Here, a
nucleus captures an inner-shell electron and undergoes a nuclear reaction that
has the same effect as $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay. Electron capture is sometimes
denoted by the letters EC. We know that electrons cannot reside in the nucleus,
but this is a nuclear reaction that consumes the electron and occurs
spontaneously only when the products have less mass than the parent plus the
electron. If a nuclide $${}_{Z}^{A}{X}_{N} $$ is known to undergo electron
capture, then its **electron capture equation** is

<div class="equation">
 $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}+{e}^{-}\to {}_{Z-1}{}^{A} {\text{Y}}_{N+1}+{\nu }_{e}\left(\text{electron capture, or EC}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>

Any nuclide that can $${\beta }^{+} $$ decay can also undergo electron capture (
and often does both). The same conservation laws are obeyed for EC as for
$${\beta }^{+} $$ decay. It is good practice to confirm these for yourself.

All forms of beta decay occur because the parent nuclide is unstable and lies
outside the region of stability in the chart of nuclides. Those nuclides that
have relatively more neutrons than those in the region of stability will
$${\beta }^{-} $$ decay to produce a daughter with fewer neutrons, producing a
daughter nearer the region of stability. Similarly, those nuclides having
relatively more protons than those in the region of stability will $${\beta
}^{-} $$ decay or undergo electron capture to produce a daughter with fewer
protons, nearer the region of stability.

### Gamma Decay

**Gamma decay**{: class="term"} is the simplest form of nuclear decay—it is the
emission of energetic photons by nuclei left in an excited state by some earlier
process. Protons and neutrons in an excited nucleus are in higher orbitals, and
they fall to lower levels by photon emission (analogous to electrons in excited
atoms). Nuclear excited states have lifetimes typically of only about $$10^{-14}
$$ s, an indication of the great strength of the forces pulling the nucleons to
lower states. The $$\gamma $$ decay equation is simply

<div class="equation">
 $${}_{Z}^{A}{\text{X}}_{N}^{*}\to {}_{Z}{}^{A} {\text{X}}_{N}+{\gamma }_{1}+{\gamma }_{2}+\cdots  \left(\gamma  \text{decay}\right) $$
</div>

where the asterisk indicates the nucleus is in an excited state. There may be
one or more $$\gamma $$ s emitted, depending on how the nuclide de-excites. In
radioactive decay, $$\gamma $$ emission is common and is preceded by $$\gamma $$
or $$\beta $$ decay. For example, when $${}^{60}\text{Co} $$ $${\beta }^{-} $$
decays, it most often leaves the daughter nucleus in an excited state, written
$${}^{60}\text{Ni*} $$ . Then the nickel nucleus quickly $$\gamma $$ decays by
the emission of two penetrating $$\gamma $$ s:

<div class="equation" >
 $${}^{60}\text{Ni*}\to {}^{60}\text{Ni}+{\gamma }_{1}+{\gamma }_{2}. $$
</div>

These are called cobalt $$\gamma $$ rays, although they come from nickel—they
are used for cancer therapy, for example. It is again constructive to verify the
conservation laws for gamma decay. Finally, since $$\gamma $$ decay does not
change the nuclide to another species, it is not prominently featured in charts
of decay series, such as that in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).

There are other types of nuclear decay, but they occur less commonly than
$$\alpha $$ , $$\beta $$ , and $$\gamma $$ decay. Spontaneous fission is the
most important of the other forms of nuclear decay because of its applications
in nuclear power and weapons. It is covered in the next chapter.

### Section Summary

* When a parent nucleus decays, it produces a daughter nucleus following rules
  and conservation laws. There are three major types of nuclear decay, called
  alpha $$\left(\alpha \right), $$ beta $$\left(\beta \right), $$ and gamma
  $$\left(\gamma \right) $$ . The $$\alpha $$ decay equation is

  <div class="equation" >
   $${}_{Z}^{A}{X}_{N}\to {}_{Z-2}^{A-4}{\text{Y}}_{N-2}+{}_{2}^{4}{\text{He}}_{2}. $$
  </div>

* Nuclear decay releases an amount of energy $$E $$ related to the mass
  destroyed $$\Delta m $$ by

  <div class="equation" >
   $$E=\left(\Delta m\right){c}^{2}. $$
  </div>

* There are three forms of beta decay. The $${\beta }^{-} $$ decay equation is

   $${}_{Z}^{A}{X}_{N}+{e}^{-}\to {}_{Z-1}^{A}{\text{Y}}_{N+1}+{\nu }_{e}. $$
  </div>

* $${\beta }^{-} $$ is an electron, $${\beta }^{+} $$ is an antielectron or
  positron, $${\nu }_{e} $$ represents an electron’s neutrino, and
  $${\overline{\nu }}_{e} $$ is an electron’s antineutrino. In addition to all
  previously known conservation laws, two new ones arise— conservation of
  electron family number and conservation of the total number of nucleons. The
  $$\gamma $$ decay equation is

  <div class="equation" >
   $${}_{Z}{}^{A} {\text{X}}_{N}^{*}\to {}_{Z}{}^{A} {\text{X}}_{N}+{\gamma }_{1}+{\gamma }_{2}+\cdots  $$
  </div>

$$\gamma $$ is a high-energy photon originating in a nucleus.

<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Star Trek fans have often heard the term “antimatter drive.” Describe how you could use a magnetic field to trap antimatter, such as produced by nuclear decay, and later combine it with matter to produce energy. Be specific about the type of antimatter, the need for vacuum storage, and the fraction of matter converted into energy.

Neutrinos are experimentally determined to have an extremely small mass. Huge numbers of neutrinos are created in a supernova at the same time as massive amounts of light are first produced. When the 1987A supernova occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, visible primarily in the Southern Hemisphere and some 100 000 light-years away from Earth, neutrinos from the explosion were observed at about the same time as the light from the blast. How could the relative arrival times of neutrinos and light be used to place limits on the mass of neutrinos?

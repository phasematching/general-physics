### Potential Energy and Conservative Forces

Work is done by a force, and some forces, such as weight, have special
characteristics. A **conservative force**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id2259527} is one, like the gravitational force, for which work
done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion
and not on the path taken. We can define a **potential energy**{: data-type="
term" #import-auto-id2177452} $$ \left(\PE\right)
$$ for any conservative force, just as we did for the gravitational force. For
example, when you wind up a toy, an egg timer, or an old-fashioned watch, you do
work against its spring and store energy in it. (We treat these springs as
ideal, in that we assume there is no friction and no production of thermal
energy.) This stored energy is recoverable as work, and it is useful to think of
it as potential energy contained in the spring. Indeed, the reason that the
spring has this characteristic is that its force is *conservative*. That is, a
conservative force results in stored or potential energy. Gravitational
potential energy is one example, as is the energy stored in a spring. We will
also see how conservative forces are related to the conservation of energy.

Potential Energy and Conservative Forces
</div>
Potential energy is the energy a system has due to position, shape, or configuration. It is stored energy that is completely recoverable.

A conservative force is one for which work done by or against it depends only on
the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken.

We can define a potential energy $$ \left(\PE\right) $$ for any
conservative force. The work done against a conservative force to reach a final
configuration depends on the configuration, not the path followed, and is the
potential energy added.

</div>

### Potential Energy of a Spring

First, let us obtain an expression for the potential energy stored in a spring (
$$ \PE_{s} $$).
 We calculate the work done to stretch or compress a spring that obeys Hooke’s
law. (Hooke’s law was examined
in [Elasticity: Stress and Strain](../contents/ch5Elasticity.md), and states that the
magnitude of force $$ F $$ on the spring and the resulting deformation $$ \Delta
L $$ are proportional, $$ F=k\Delta L $$.) (See [[Figure]](#fs-id1593673).) For
our spring, we will replace $$ \Delta L $$
(the amount of deformation produced by a force $$ F $$)
by the distance $$ x $$ that the spring is stretched or compressed along its
length. So the force needed to stretch the spring has magnitude $$ F = kx
$$, where $$ k $$ is the spring’s force constant. The force increases linearly
from 0 at the start to $$ kx $$ in the fully stretched position. The
average force is $$ k x/2 $$. Thus the work done in stretching or
compressing the spring is $$ W_{s}=F d =\left(\frac{ k x}{2}\right)
x=\frac{1}{2}k x^{2} $$. Alternatively, we noted
in [Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem](../contents/ch7KineticEnergyAndTheWorkEnergyTheorem.md) that the area
under a graph of $$ F $$ vs. $$ x $$ is the work done by the force.
In [[Figure]](#fs-id1593673)(c) we see that this area is also $$ \frac{1}{2}k
x^{2} $$. We therefore define the **potential energy of a spring**{: data-type="
term"}, $$ \PE_{s} $$, to be

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \PE_{\s}=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2} , $$
</div>

where $$ k $$ is the spring’s force constant and $$ x $$ is the displacement
from its undeformed position. The potential energy represents the work done *on*
the spring and the energy stored in it as a result of stretching or compressing
it a distance $$ x $$. The potential energy of the spring $$ \PE_{s} $$
does not depend on the path taken; it depends only on the stretch or squeeze $$
x $$ in the final configuration.

![An undeformed spring fixed at one end with no potential energy. (b) A spring fixed at one end and stretched by a distance x by a force F equal to k x. Work done W is equal to one half k x squared. P E s is equal to one half k x squared. (c) A graph of force F versus elongation x in the spring. A straight line inclined to x axis starts from origin. The area under this line forms a right triangle with base of x and height of k x. Area of this triangle is equal to one half k x squared.](../resources/Figure_08_04_01a.jpg "(a) An undeformed spring has no
\( \PE_{\text{s}} \) stored in it. (b) The force needed to stretch (or compress) the spring a distance \( x \)  has a
magnitude \( F = k x \) , and the work done to stretch (or compress) it is \( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \)
. Because the force is conservative, this work is stored as potential energy, \( \PE_{\text{s}} \),  in the spring, and it can be fully recovered.
(c) A graph of \( F \)  vs. \( x \)  has a slope of \( k \) , and the area under the graph is \( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \). Thus the work done or potential energy stored is \( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \). ")

The equation $$ \PE_{s}=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2} $$ has general validity
beyond the special case for which it was derived. Potential energy can be stored
in any elastic medium by deforming it. Indeed, the general definition of
**potential energy**{: data-type="term"} is energy due to position, shape, or
configuration. For shape or position deformations, stored energy is $$
\PE_{s}=\frac{1}{2}k x^{2} $$, where $$ k $$ is the force constant of
the particular system and $$ x $$ is its deformation. Another example is seen
in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id1089734) for a guitar string.

![A six-string guitar is placed vertically. The left-most string is plucked in the left direction with a force F shown by an arrow pointing left. The displacement of the string from the mean position is d. The plucked string is labeled P E sub string, to represent the potential energy of the string.](../resources/Figure_08_04_02a.jpg "Work is done to deform the guitar string, giving it potential energy. When released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back to potential as the string oscillates back and forth. A very small fraction is dissipated as sound energy, slowly removing energy from the string.")

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Let us now consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when only
conservative forces are involved. This will lead us to the conservation of
energy principle. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done by all
forces acting on a system equals its change in kinetic energy. In equation form,
this is

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{net}}=\frac{1}{2}m v^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{0}^{2}
=\Delta \KE . $$
</div>

If only conservative forces act, then

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{net}}=W_{\text{c}}, $$
</div>

where $$ W_{c} $$ is the total work done by all conservative forces. Thus,

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{c}}=\Delta \KE . $$
</div>

Now, if the conservative force, such as the gravitational force or a spring
force, does work, the system loses potential energy. That is, $$ W_\text{c}=-\Delta \PE $$.
Therefore,

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ -\Delta \PE=\Delta \KE $$
</div>

or

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \Delta \KE+\Delta \PE=0. $$
</div>

This equation means that the total kinetic and potential energy is constant for
any process involving only conservative forces. That is,

<div data-type="equation">
 $$
\left.
\begin{array}{cc}
&
\KE+\PE= \text{constant }\\
& \text{or} & \\
& \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}
=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}
\end{array}
\right\}
\text{(conservative forces only),} $$
</div>

where i and f denote initial and final values. This equation is a form of the
work-energy theorem for conservative forces; it is known as the **conservation
of mechanical energy**{: data-type="term"} principle. Remember that this applies
to the extent that all the forces are conservative, so that friction is
negligible. The total kinetic plus potential energy of a system is defined to be
its **mechanical energy**{: data-type="term"}, $$ \left(\KE+\PE\right) $$.
In a system that experiences only conservative
forces, there is a potential energy associated with each force, and the energy
only changes form between $$ \KE $$ and the various types of $$ \PE $$,
with the total energy remaining constant.

Using Conservation of Mechanical Energy to Calculate the Speed of a Toy Car
</div>
A 0.100-kg toy car is propelled by a compressed spring, as shown in [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2687249). The car follows a track that rises 0.180 m above the starting point. The spring is compressed 4.00 cm and has a force constant of 250.0 N/m. Assuming work done by friction to be negligible, find (a) how fast the car is going before it starts up the slope and (b) how fast it is going at the top of the slope.

![The figure shows a toy race car that has just been released from a spring. Two possible paths for the car are shown. One path has a gradual upward incline, leveling off at a height of eighteen centimeters above its starting level. An alternative path shows the car descending from its starting point, making a loop, and then ascending back up and leveling off at a height of eighteen centimeters above its starting level. ](../resources/Figure_08_04_03a.jpg "A toy car is pushed by a compressed spring and coasts up a slope. Assuming negligible friction, the potential energy in the spring is first completely converted to kinetic energy, and then to a combination of kinetic and gravitational potential energy as the car rises. The details of the path are unimportant because all forces are conservative&#x2014;the car would have the same final speed if it took the alternate path shown.")

**Strategy**

The spring force and the gravitational force are conservative forces, so
conservation of mechanical energy can be used. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-576">
 $$
\KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}=
\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}} $$
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-82">
 $$
\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2}+ mgh_{i}+ \frac{1}{2} k x_{i}^{2}=
\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}+ mgh_{f}+ \frac{1}{2} k x_{f}^{2}, $$
</div>
where $$ h $$ is the height (vertical position) and $$ x $$
is the compression of the spring. This general statement looks complex but
becomes much simpler when we start considering specific situations. First, we
must identify the initial and final conditions in a problem; then, we enter them
into the last equation to solve for an unknown.

**Solution for (a)**

This part of the problem is limited to conditions just before the car is
released and just after it leaves the spring. Take the initial height to be
zero, so that both $$ h_{\text{i}} $$ and $$ h_{\text{f}} $$ are zero.
Furthermore, the initial speed $$ v_{\text{i}} $$ is zero and the final
compression of the spring $$ x_{\text{f}} $$ is zero, and so several terms in
the conservation of mechanical energy equation are zero and it simplifies to

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-654">
 $$ \frac{1}{2}k x_{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}. $$
</div>
In other words, the initial potential energy in the spring is converted completely
to kinetic energy in the absence of friction.
Solving for the final speed and entering known values yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-196">
$$ \begin{array}{lll}
v_{f}& =& \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x_{i}  \\
     & =& \sqrt{\frac{250.0 \text{N/m}}{0.100 \kg } } \left(0.0400 \m \right)\\
     & =& 2.00 \ms .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

One method of finding the speed at the top of the slope is to consider
conditions just before the car is released and just after it reaches the top of
the slope, completely ignoring everything in between. Doing the same type of
analysis to find which terms are zero, the conservation of mechanical energy
becomes

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \frac{1}{2} kx_\text{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m v_\text{f}^{2}+mgh_\text{f}. $$
</div>
This form of the equation means that the spring’s initial potential energy is
converted partly to gravitational potential energy and partly to kinetic
energy. The final speed at the top of the slope will be less than at the bottom.
Solving for $$ v_{\text{f}} $$ and substituting known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-334">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v_{f}& =& \sqrt{\frac{ k x_{\text{i}}^{2}}{m}-2 g h_{\text{f}}}\\
     & =& \sqrt{\left(\frac{250.0 \text{N/m}}{0.100 \kg }\right)
\left(0.0400 \m \right)^{2}-2\left(9.80\mss \right) \left(0.180 \m \right) }\\
 & =& 0.687 \ms .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the car’s kinetic energy
before it goes up the slope is converted partly to potential energy—that is, to
take the final conditions in part (a) to be the initial conditions in part (b).

</div>

Note that, for conservative forces, we do not directly calculate the work they
do; rather, we consider their effects through their corresponding potential
energies, just as we did in [[Figure]](#fs-id1893243). Note also that we do not
consider details of the path taken—only the starting and ending points are
important (as long as the path is not impossible). This assumption is usually a
tremendous simplification, because the path may be complicated and forces may
vary along the way.

### Section Summary

* A conservative force is one for which work depends only on the starting and
  ending points of a motion, not on the path taken.
* We can define potential energy $$ \left(\PE\right) $$ for any
  conservative force, just as we defined $$ \PE_{g} $$ for the
  gravitational force.
* The potential energy of a spring is $$ \PE_{s}=\frac{1}{2}k x^{2} $$,
  where $$ k $$ is the spring’s force constant and $$ x $$ is the displacement
  from its undeformed position.
* Mechanical energy is defined to be $$ \KE+\PE $$ for a
  conservative force.
* When only conservative forces act on and within a system, the total mechanical
  energy is constant. In equation form,

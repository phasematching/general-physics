You have no doubt heard the word **pressure** being used in relation to blood (
high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and
low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures
in fluids. Pressure $$P $$ is defined as

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{F}{A} $$
</div>

where $$F $$ is a force applied to an area $$A $$ that is perpendicular to the
force.

Pressure
</div>
Pressure is defined as the force divided by the area perpendicular to the force over which the force is applied, or

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{F}{A}. $$
</div>
</div>

A given force can have a significantly different effect depending on the area
over which the force is exerted, as shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). The SI unit
for pressure is the *pascal*, where

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{Pa}=1 {\text{N/m}}^{2}. $$
</div>

In addition to the pascal, there are many other units for pressure that are in
common use. In meteorology, atmospheric pressure is often described in units of
millibar (mb), where

<div class="equation" >
 $$100 \text{mb}=1 \times 10^{4}  \text{Pa} . $$
</div>

Pounds per square inch $$\left({\text{lb/in}}^{2} \text{ or } \text{psi}\right) $$
is still sometimes used as a measure of tire pressure, and millimeters of
mercury (mm Hg) is still often used in the measurement of blood pressure.
Pressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when
discussing fluids.

(b) In contrast, the same force applied to an area the size of the sharp end of a needle is great enough to break the skin.")

Calculating Force Exerted by the Air: What Force Does a Pressure Exert?
</div>
An astronaut is working outside the International Space Station where the atmospheric pressure is essentially zero. The pressure gauge on her air tank reads  $$ 6.90 \times 10^{6}  \text{Pa} $$ .
 What force does the air inside the tank exert on the flat end of the cylindrical tank, a disk 0.150 m in diameter?

**Strategy**

We can find the force exerted from the definition of pressure given in
$$P=\frac{F}{A} $$ , provided we can find the area $$A $$ acted upon.

**Solution**

By rearranging the definition of pressure to solve for force, we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=PA. $$
</div>
Here, the pressure  $$P $$ is given, as is the area of the end of the cylinder  $$A $$ ,
 given by  $$A=\pi r^2 $$ .
 Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}F& =& \left( 6.90 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}\right)\left(3.14\right){\left(0.0750 m\right)}^{2}\\ & =&  1.22 \times 10^{5}  \text{N} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Wow! No wonder the tank must be strong. Since we found $$F=PA $$ , we see that
the force exerted by a pressure is directly proportional to the area acted upon
as well as the pressure itself.

</div>

The force exerted on the end of the tank is perpendicular to its inside surface.
This direction is because the force is exerted by a static or stationary fluid.
We have already seen that fluids cannot *withstand* shearing (sideways) forces;
they cannot *exert* shearing forces, either. Fluid pressure has no direction,
being a scalar quantity. The forces due to pressure have well-defined
directions: they are always exerted perpendicular to any surface. (See the tire
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), for example.) Finally, note that pressure is exerted
on all surfaces. Swimmers, as well as the tire, feel pressure on all sides. (
See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![The forces inside a tire are shown by arrow lines. An inset shows an enlarged view of the valve in the tire. Air pressure in the tire keeps the valve closed.](../resources/Figure_11_03_02a.jpg "Pressure inside this tire exerts forces perpendicular to all surfaces it contacts. The arrows give representative directions and magnitudes of the forces exerted at various points. Note that static fluids do not exert shearing forces.")

![A man swimming underwater has many arrows pointing toward him to represent the directions and magnitudes of the forces exerted on him at various points.](../resources/Figure_11_03_03a.jpg "Pressure is exerted on all sides of this swimmer, since the water would flow into the space he occupies if he were not there. The arrows represent the directions and magnitudes of the forces exerted at various points on the swimmer. Note that the forces are larger underneath, due to greater depth, giving a net upward or buoyant force that is balanced by the weight of the swimmer.")

### Section Summary

* Pressure is the force per unit perpendicular area over which the force is
  applied. In equation form, pressure is defined as

  <div class="equation" >
   $$P=\frac{F}{A}\text{.} $$
  </div>

* The SI unit of pressure is pascal and $$1 \text{Pa}=1 {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ .

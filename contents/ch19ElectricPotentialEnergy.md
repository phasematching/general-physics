When a free positive charge $$q $$ is accelerated by an electric field, such as
shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), it is given kinetic energy. The process is
analogous to an object being accelerated by a gravitational field. It is as if
the charge is going down an electrical hill where its electric potential energy
is converted to kinetic energy. Let us explore the work done on a charge $$q $$
by the electric field in this process, so that we may develop a definition of
electric potential energy.

![A charge plus q moves from a positive to a negative sheet of charge. The change in the electric potential energy equals the change in kinetic energy. This is similar to the change from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy when an object of mass m rolls downhill.](../resources/Figure_20_01_01a.jpg "A charge accelerated by an electric field is analogous to a mass going down a hill. In both cases potential energy is converted to another form. Work is done by a force, but since this force is conservative, we can write \( W = - \Delta PE \).")
{: #Figure1}

The electrostatic or Coulomb force is conservative, which means that the work
done on $$q $$ is independent of the path taken. This is exactly analogous to
the gravitational force in the absence of dissipative forces such as friction.
When a force is conservative, it is possible to define a potential energy
associated with the force, and it is usually easier to deal with the potential
energy (because it depends only on position) than to calculate the work
directly.

We use the letters PE to denote electric potential energy, which has units of
joules (J). The change in potential energy, $$\Delta \text{PE} $$ , is crucial,
since the work done by a conservative force is the negative of the change in
potential energy; that is, $$W=-\Delta\text{PE} $$ . For example, work $$W $$
done to accelerate a positive charge from rest is positive and results from a
loss in PE, or a negative $$\Delta \text{PE} $$ . There must be a minus sign in
front of $$\Delta \text{PE} $$ to make $$W $$ positive. PE can be found at any
point by taking one point as a reference and calculating the work needed to move
a charge to the other point.

 $$W=-\Delta \text{PE} $$ .
 For example, work  $$W $$
 done to accelerate a positive charge from rest is positive and results from a loss in PE, or a negative  $$\Delta \text{PE}. $$
 There must be a minus sign in front of  $$\Delta \text{PE} $$
 to make  $$W $$

</div>

Gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy are quite
analogous. Potential energy accounts for work done by a conservative force and
gives added insight regarding energy and energy transformation without the
necessity of dealing with the force directly. It is much more common, for
example, to use the concept of voltage (related to electric potential energy)
than to deal with the Coulomb force directly.

Calculating the work directly is generally difficult, since $$W=Fd \cos \theta
$$ and the direction and magnitude of $$F $$ can be complex for multiple
charges, for odd-shaped objects, and along arbitrary paths. But we do know that,
since $$F=qE $$ , the work, and hence $$\Delta \text{PE} $$ , is proportional to
the test charge $$q. $$ To have a physical quantity that is independent of test
charge, we define **electric potential**  $$V $$
(or simply potential, since electric is understood) to be the potential energy
per unit charge:

<div class="equation" >
 $$V=\frac{\text{PE}}{q}\text{.} $$
</div>

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Electric Potential
</div>
This is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

<div class="equation" >
 $$V=\frac{\text{PE}}{q} $$
</div>
</div>

Since PE is proportional to $$q $$ , the dependence on $$q $$ cancels. Thus $$V
$$ does not depend on $$q $$ . The change in potential energy $$\Delta \text{PE}
$$ is crucial, and so we are concerned with the difference in potential or
potential difference $$\Delta V $$ between two points, where

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V={V}_{\text{B}}-{V}_{\text{A}}=\frac{\Delta \text{PE}}{q}\text{.} $$
</div>

The **potential difference** between points A and B, $${V}_{\text{B}} - {V}_
{\text{A}} $$ , is thus defined to be the change in potential energy of a charge
$$q $$ moved from A to B, divided by the charge. Units of potential difference
are joules per coulomb, given the name volt (V) after Alessandro Volta.

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{V} = 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{C}} $$
</div>

Potential Difference
</div>
The potential difference between points A and B,  $${V}_{B}-{V}_{A} $$ ,
 is defined to be the change in potential energy of a charge $$ q $$ moved from A to B, divided by the charge. Units of potential difference are joules per coulomb, given the name volt (V) after Alessandro Volta.

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{V} = 1 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{C}} $$
</div>
</div>

The familiar term **voltage**{: class="term"} is the common name for potential
difference. Keep in mind that whenever a voltage is quoted, it is understood to
be the potential difference between two points. For example, every battery has
two terminals, and its voltage is the potential difference between them. More
fundamentally, the point you choose to be zero volts is arbitrary. This is
analogous to the fact that gravitational potential energy has an arbitrary zero,
such as sea level or perhaps a lecture hall floor.

In summary, the relationship between potential difference (or voltage) and
electrical potential energy is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\frac{\Delta \text{PE}}{q} \text{and} \Delta \text{PE} = q\Delta V\text{.} $$

Potential Difference and Electrical Potential Energy
</div>
The relationship between potential difference (or voltage) and electrical potential energy is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\frac{\Delta \text{PE}}{q} \text{and}  \Delta \text{PE} = q\Delta V\text{.} $$
</div>
The second equation is equivalent to the first.

</div>

Voltage is not the same as energy. Voltage is the energy per unit charge. Thus a
motorcycle battery and a car battery can both have the same voltage (more
precisely, the same potential difference between battery terminals), yet one
stores much more energy than the other since $$\Delta \text{PE} = q\Delta V $$ .
The car battery can move more charge than the motorcycle battery, although both
are 12 V batteries.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Energy
</div>
Suppose you have a 12.0 V motorcycle battery that can move 5000 C of charge, and a 12.0 V car battery that can move 60 000 C of charge. How much energy does each deliver? (Assume that the numerical value of each charge is accurate to three significant figures.)

**Strategy**

To say we have a 12.0 V battery means that its terminals have a 12.0 V potential
difference. When such a battery moves charge, it puts the charge through a
potential difference of 12.0 V, and the charge is given a change in potential
energy equal to $$\Delta \text{PE} = q\Delta V $$.

So to find the energy output, we multiply the charge moved by the potential
difference.

**Solution**

For the motorcycle battery, $$q=5000 \text{C} $$ and $$\Delta V=12.0 \text{V} $$
. The total energy delivered by the motorcycle battery is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta \text{PE}_{\text{cycle}}& =& \left(5000 \text{C}\right)\left(12.0 \text{V}\right)\\ & =& \left(5000 \text{C}\right)\left(12.0 \text{J/C}\right)\\ & =&  6.00 \times 10^{4}  \text{J} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
Similarly, for the car battery,  $$q=60 000 \text{C} $$  and

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\Delta \text{PE}_{\text{car}}& =& \left(60 000 \text{C}\right)\left(12.0 \text{V}\right)\\ & =&  7.20 \times 10^{5}  \text{J} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

While voltage and energy are related, they are not the same thing. The voltages
of the batteries are identical, but the energy supplied by each is quite
different. Note also that as a battery is discharged, some of its energy is used
internally and its terminal voltage drops, such as when headlights dim because
of a low car battery. The energy supplied by the battery is still calculated as
in this example, but not all of the energy is available for external use.

</div>

Note that the energies calculated in the previous example are absolute values.
The change in potential energy for the battery is negative, since it loses
energy. These batteries, like many electrical systems, actually move negative
chargeâ€”electrons in particular. The batteries repel electrons from their
negative terminals (A) through whatever circuitry is involved and attract them
to their positive terminals (B) as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). The change
in potential is $$\Delta V={V}_{\text{B}}-V_{\text{A}}=+12 \text{V} $$ and the
charge $$q $$ is negative, so that $$\Delta \text{PE}=q\Delta V $$ is negative,
meaning the potential energy of the battery has decreased when $$q $$ has moved
from A to B.

![A headlight is connected to a 12 V battery. Negative charges move from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal, resulting in a current flow and making the headlight glow. However, the positive terminal is at a greater potential than the negative terminal.](../resources/Figure_20_01_02a.jpg "A battery moves negative charge from its negative terminal through a headlight to its positive terminal. Appropriate combinations of chemicals in the battery separate charges so that the negative terminal has an excess of negative charge, which is repelled by it and attracted to the excess positive charge on the other terminal. In terms of potential, the positive terminal is at a higher voltage than the negative. Inside the battery, both positive and negative charges move.")

<div class="title">
How Many Electrons Move through a Headlight Each Second?
</div>
When a 12.0 V car battery runs a single 30.0 W headlight, how many electrons pass through it each second?

**Strategy**

To find the number of electrons, we must first find the charge that moved in
1.00 s. The charge moved is related to voltage and energy through the equation
$$\Delta \text{PE}=q\Delta V $$ . A 30.0 W lamp uses 30.0 joules per second.
Since the battery loses energy, we have $$\Delta \text{PE}=-30.0 \text{J} $$
and, since the electrons are going from the negative terminal to the positive,
we see that $$\Delta V=+12.0 \text{V} $$.

**Solution**

To find the charge $$ q $$ moved, we solve the equation $$\Delta
\text{PE}=q\Delta V $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$q=\frac{\Delta \text{PE}}{\Delta V}\text{.} $$
</div>
Entering the values for  $$\Delta \text{PE} $$
 and  $$\Delta V $$ ,  we get

<div class="equation" >
 $$q=\frac{-30.0 \text{J}}{+12.0 \text{V}}=\frac{-30.0 \text{J}}{+12.0 \text{J/C}}= -2.50 C. $$
</div>
The number of electrons  $${\text{n}}_{\text{e}} $$
 is the total charge divided by the charge per electron. That is,

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{n}}_{\text{e}}=\frac{-2.50\text{C}}{-1.60 \times 10^{-19} {\text{C/e}}^{-}}= 1.56 \times 10^{19}  \text{electrons} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This is a very large number. It is no wonder that we do not ordinarily observe
individual electrons with so many being present in ordinary systems. In fact,
electricity had been in use for many decades before it was determined that the
moving charges in many circumstances were negative. Positive charge moving in
the opposite direction of negative charge often produces identical effects; this
makes it difficult to determine which is moving or whether both are moving.

</div>

### The Electron Volt

The energy per electron is very small in macroscopic situations like that in the
previous exampleâ€”a tiny fraction of a joule. But on a submicroscopic scale, such
energy per particle (electron, proton, or ion) can be of great importance. For
example, even a tiny fraction of a joule can be great enough for these particles
to destroy organic molecules and harm living tissue. The particle may do its
damage by direct collision, or it may create harmful x rays, which can also
inflict damage. It is useful to have an energy unit related to submicroscopic
effects. [[link]](#fs-id1493012) shows a situation related to the definition of
such an energy unit. An electron is accelerated between two charged metal plates
as it might be in an old-model television tube or oscilloscope. The electron is
given kinetic energy that is later converted to another formâ€”light in the
television tube, for example. (Note that downhill for the electron is uphill for
a positive charge.) Since energy is related to voltage by $$\Delta
\text{PE}=q\Delta V, $$ we can think of the joule as a coulomb-volt.

![In an electron gun the electrons move from the negatively charged plate to the positively charged plate. Their kinetic energy will be equal to the potential energy.](../resources/Figure_20_01_03a.jpg "A typical electron gun accelerates electrons using a potential difference between two metal plates. The energy of the electron in electron volts is numerically the same as the voltage between the plates. For example, a 5000 V potential difference produces 5000 eV electrons.")


On the submicroscopic scale, it is more convenient to define an energy unit
called the **electron volt** (eV), which is the energy given to a fundamental
charge accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V. In equation form,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}1 \text{eV}& =& \left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1 V\right)=\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1 \text{J/C}\right)\\ & =& 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{J} \text{.} \end{array} $$

On the submicroscopic scale, it is more convenient to define an energy unit called the electron volt (eV), which is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V*.* In equation form,

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}1 \text{eV}& =& \left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1 V\right)=\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(1 \text{J/C}\right)\\ & =& 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{J} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
</div>

An electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V is given an energy
of 1 eV. It follows that an electron accelerated through 50 V is given 50 eV. A
potential difference of 100 000 V (100 kV) will give an electron an energy of
100 000 eV (100 keV), and so on. Similarly, an ion with a double positive charge
accelerated through 100 V will be given 200 eV of energy. These simple
relationships between accelerating voltage and particle charges make the
electron volt a simple and convenient energy unit in such circumstances.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Connections: Energy Units
</div>
The electron volt (eV) is the most common energy unit for submicroscopic processes. This will be particularly noticeable in the chapters on modern physics. Energy is so important to so many subjects that there is a tendency to define a special energy unit for each major topic. There are, for example, calories for food energy, kilowatt-hours for electrical energy, and therms for natural gas energy.

</div>

The electron volt is commonly employed in submicroscopic processesâ€”chemical
valence energies and molecular and nuclear binding energies are among the
quantities often expressed in electron volts. For example, about 5 eV of energy
is required to break up certain organic molecules. If a proton is accelerated
from rest through a potential difference of 30 kV, it is given an energy of 30
keV (30 000 eV) and it can break up as many as 6000 of these molecules ( $$30
000 \text{eV}Ã·5 \text{eV per molecule}=6000 \text{molecules} $$ ). Nuclear decay
energies are on the order of 1 MeV (1 000 000 eV) per event and can, thus,
produce significant biological damage.

### Conservation of Energy

The total energy of a system is conserved if there is no net addition (or
subtraction) of work or heat transfer. For conservative forces, such as the
electrostatic force, conservation of energy states that mechanical energy is a
constant.

**Mechanical energy** is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of a
system; that is, $$\text{KE}+\text{PE = constant} $$ . A loss of PE of a charged
particle becomes an increase in its KE. Here PE is the electric potential
energy. Conservation of energy is stated in equation form as

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{KE}+\text{PE = constant} $$
</div>

or

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{KE}_{i}+\text{PE}_{i} = \text{KE}_{f}+\text{PE}_{f}, $$
</div>

where i and f stand for initial and final conditions. As we have found many
times before, considering energy can give us insights and facilitate problem-solving.

<div class="title">
Electrical Potential Energy Converted to Kinetic Energy
</div>
Calculate the final speed of a free electron accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 100 V. (Assume that this numerical value is accurate to three significant figures.)

**Strategy**

We have a system with only conservative forces. Assuming the electron is
accelerated in a vacuum, and neglecting the gravitational force (we will check
on this assumption later), all of the electrical potential energy is converted
into kinetic energy. We can identify the initial and final forms of energy to be
$${\text{KE}}_{i}=0, {\text{KE}}_{f}=Â½mv^{2}, {\text{PE}}_{i}=qV{\text{, and
PE}}_{f}=0. $$
**Solution**

Conservation of energy states that

<div class="equation" >
 $${\text{KE}}_{i}+{\text{PE}}_{i}{= \text{KE}}_{f}+{\text{PE}}_{f}\text{.} $$
</div>
Entering the forms identified above, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$qV=\frac{ mv^{2}}{2}\text{.} $$
</div>
We solve this for  $$v $$
*\:*

<div class="equation" >
 $$v=\sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}}\text{.} $$
</div>
Entering values for  $$q, V\text{, and} m $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}v& =& \sqrt{\frac{2\left(-1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left(-100 \text{J/C}\right)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}}}\\ & =&  5.93 \times 10^{6}  \text{m/s} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Note that both the charge and the initial voltage are negative, as
in [[link]](#fs-id1493012). From the discussions
in [Electric Charge and Electric Field](/ch18ElectricChargeAndElectricField), we
know that electrostatic forces on small particles are generally very large
compared with the gravitational force. The large final speed confirms that the
gravitational force is indeed negligible here. The large speed also indicates
how easy it is to accelerate electrons with small voltages because of their very
small mass. Voltages much higher than the 100 V in this problem are typically
used in electron guns. Those higher voltages produce electron speeds so great
that relativistic effects must be taken into account. That is why a low voltage
is considered (accurately) in this example.

</div>

(a)  $$ 1.44 \times 10^{12}  \text{V} $$
(b) This voltage is very high. A 10.0 cm diameter sphere could never maintain this voltage; it would discharge.

(c) An 8.00 C charge is more charge than can reasonably be accumulated on a
sphere of that size.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider a battery used to supply energy to a cellular phone. Construct a
problem in which you determine the energy that must be supplied by the battery,
and then calculate the amount of charge it must be able to move in order to
supply this energy. Among the things to be considered are the energy needs and
battery voltage. You may need to look ahead to interpret manufacturerâ€™s battery
ratings in ampere-hours as energy in joules.

### Glossary
{: class="glossary-title"}

electric potential
: potential energy per unit charge

potential difference (or voltage)
: change in potential energy of a charge moved from one point to another,
divided by the charge; units of potential difference are joules per coulomb,
known as volt

electron volt
: the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential
difference of one volt

mechanical energy
: sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of a system; this sum is a
constant

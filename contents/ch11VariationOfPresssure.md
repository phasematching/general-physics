<div class="abstract" markdown="1">
* Define pressure in terms of weight.
* Explain the variation of pressure with depth in a fluid.
* Calculate density given pressure and altitude.
</div>

If your ears have ever popped on a plane flight or ached during a deep dive in a
swimming pool, you have experienced the effect of depth on pressure in a fluid.
At the Earth’s surface, the air pressure exerted on you is a result of the
weight of air above you. This pressure is reduced as you climb up in altitude
and the weight of air above you decreases. Under water, the pressure exerted on
you increases with increasing depth. In this case, the pressure being exerted
upon you is a result of both the weight of water above you *and* that of the
atmosphere above you. You may notice an air pressure change on an elevator ride
that transports you many stories, but you need only dive a meter or so below the
surface of a pool to feel a pressure increase. The difference is that water is
much denser than air, about 775 times as dense.

Consider the container in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1). Its bottom supports the weight
of the fluid in it. Let us calculate the pressure exerted on the bottom by the
weight of the fluid. That **pressure** is the weight of the fluid $$mg $$
divided by the area $$A $$ supporting it (the area of the bottom of the
container):

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{mg}{A}. $$
</div>

We can find the mass of the fluid from its volume and density:

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=\rho V. $$
</div>

The volume of the fluid $$V $$ is related to the dimensions of the container. It
is

<div class="equation" >
 $$V=Ah, $$
</div>

where $$A $$ is the cross-sectional area and $$h $$ is the depth. Combining the
last two equations gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$m=\rho Ah. $$
</div>

If we enter this into the expression for pressure, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{\left(\rho Ah\right)g}{A}. $$
</div>

The area cancels, and rearranging the variables yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=h \rho g. $$
</div>

This value is the *pressure due to the weight of a fluid*. The equation has
general validity beyond the special conditions under which it is derived here.
Even if the container were not there, the surrounding fluid would still exert
this pressure, keeping the fluid static. Thus the equation $$P=h \rho g $$
represents the pressure due to the weight of any fluid of *average density*
$$\rho $$ at any depth $$h $$ below its surface. For liquids, which are nearly
incompressible, this equation holds to great depths. For gases, which are quite
compressible, one can apply this equation as long as the density changes are
small over the depth considered. [[link]](#fs-id1859777) illustrates this
situation.

A denotes the area of the fluid at the bottom of the container and as well as on the surface.](../resources/Figure_12_04_01a.jpg "The bottom of this container supports the entire weight of the fluid in it. The vertical sides cannot exert an upward force on the fluid (since it cannot withstand a shearing force), and so the bottom must support it all.")

Calculating the Average Pressure and Force Exerted: What Force Must a Dam Withstand?
</div>
In [[link]](/m42187#fs-id2449267), we calculated the mass of water in a large reservoir. We will now consider the pressure and force acting on the dam retaining water. (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) The dam is 500 m wide, and the water is 80.0 m deep at the dam. (a) What is the average pressure on the dam due to the water? (b) Calculate the force exerted against the dam and compare it with the weight of water in the dam (previously found to be  $$1.96 \times 10^{13}  \text{N} $$ ). 

**Strategy for (a)**

The average pressure $$\overline{P} $$ due to the weight of the water is the
pressure at the average depth $$\overline{h} $$ of 40.0 m, since pressure
increases linearly with depth.

**Solution for (a)**

The average pressure due to the weight of a fluid is

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{P}=\overline{h}\rho g. $$
</div>
Entering the density of water from [[Table 1]](../contents//ch11Density#Table1) and taking  $$\overline{h} $$
 to be the average depth of 40.0 m, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\overline{P}& =& \left(40.0 \text{m}\right)\left(10^{3} \frac{\text{kg}}{ {\text{m}}^{3}}\right)\left(9.80 \frac{\text{m}}{ {\text{s}}^{2}}\right)\\ & =&  3.92 \times 10^{5}  \frac{\text{N}}{ {\text{m}}^{2}}=392 \text{kPa} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Strategy for (b)**

The force exerted on the dam by the water is the average pressure times the area
of contact:

<div class="equation" >
 $$F=\overline{P}A. $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

We have already found the value for $$\overline{P} $$ . The area of the dam is
$$A=80.0 \text{m}×500 \text{m}= 4.00 \times 10^{4} {\text{m}}^{2} $$ , so that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}F& =& \left( 3.92 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}\right)\left( 4.00 \times 10^{4}  {\text{m}}^{2}\right)\\ & =&  1.57 \times 10^{10}  \text{N} \text{.} \end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Although this force seems large, it is small compared with the $$ 1.96 \times
10^{13} \text{N} $$ weight of the water in the reservoir—in fact, it is only
$$0.0800\% $$ of the weight. Note that the pressure found in part (a) is
completely independent of the width and length of the lake—it depends only on
its average depth at the dam. Thus the force depends only on the water’s average
depth and the dimensions of the dam, *not* on the horizontal extent of the
reservoir. In the diagram, the thickness of the dam increases with depth to
balance the increasing force due to the increasing pressure depth to balance the
increasing force due to the increasing pressure.

</div>

![A two-dimensional view of a dam with dimensions L and h is shown. Force F at h is shown by a horizontal arrow. The force F exerted by water on the dam is F equals average pressure p bar into area A and pressure in turn is average height h bar into density rho into acceleration due to gravity g.](../resources/Figure_12_04_02a.jpg "The dam must withstand the force exerted against it by the water it retains. This force is small compared with the weight of the water behind the dam.")
{: #Figure2}

*Atmospheric pressure* is another example of pressure due to the weight of a
fluid, in this case due to the weight of *air* above a given height. The
atmospheric pressure at the Earth’s surface varies a little due to the
large-scale flow of the atmosphere induced by the Earth’s rotation (this creates
weather “highs” and “lows”). However, the average pressure at sea level is given
by the *standard atmospheric pressure*  $${P}_{\text{atm}} $$ , measured to be

<div class="equation" >
 $$1 \text{atmosphere (atm)}={P}_{\text{atm}}= 1.01 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}=101 \text{kPa}. $$
</div>

This relationship means that, on average, at sea level, a column of air above
$$1.00 {\text{m}}^{2} $$ of the Earth’s surface has a weight of $$ 1.01 \times
10^{5} \text{N} $$ , equivalent to $$1 \text{atm} $$ .
(See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).)

![Figure shows a column of air exerting a weight of one point zero one times ten to the power five newtons on a rectangular patch of ground of one square meter cross section.](../resources/Figure_12_04_03a.jpg "Atmospheric pressure at sea level averages \( 1.01 \times 10^5 \text{Pa} \) (equivalent to 1 atm), since the column of air over this \( 1 \text{m}^2 \), extending to the top of the atmosphere, weighs \( 1.01 \times 10^5 \text{N} \) .")

Calculating Average Density: How Dense Is the Air?
</div>
Calculate the average density of the atmosphere, given that it extends to an altitude of 120 km. Compare this density with that of air listed in [[link]](../contents//ch11Density#Table1).

**Strategy**

If we solve $$P=h \rho g $$ for density, we see that

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{\rho }=\frac{P}{\text{hg}}. $$
</div>
We then take  $$P $$  to be atmospheric pressure,  $$h $$  is given, and  $$g $$
 is known, and so we can use this to calculate  $$\overline{\rho } $$.

**Solution**

Entering known values into the expression for $$\overline{\rho } $$ yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$\overline{\rho }=\frac{ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}}{\left(120 \times 10^{3}  \text{m}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)}= 8.59 \times 10^{-2}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This result is the average density of air between the Earth’s surface and the
top of the Earth’s atmosphere, which essentially ends at 120 km. The density of
air at sea level is given in [[Table 1]](../contents//ch11Density#Table1) as $$ 1.29
{\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$ —about 15 times its average value. Because air is so
compressible, its density has its highest value near the Earth’s surface and
declines rapidly with altitude.

Calculating Depth Below the Surface of Water: What Depth of Water Creates the Same Pressure as the Entire Atmosphere?
</div>
Calculate the depth below the surface of water at which the pressure due to the weight of the water equals 1.00 atm.

**Strategy**

We begin by solving the equation $$P=h \rho g $$ for depth $$h $$ \:

<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{P}{\rho g}. $$
</div>
Then we take  $$P $$
 to be 1.00 atm and  $$\rho  $$
 to be the density of the water that creates the pressure.

**Solution**

Entering the known values into the expression for $$h $$ gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$h=\frac{ 1.01 \times 10^{5}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}}{\left( 1.00 \times 10^{3}  {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)}= 10.3 \text{m}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Just 10.3 m of water creates the same pressure as 120 km of air. Since water is
nearly incompressible, we can neglect any change in its density over this depth.

</div>

What do you suppose is the *total* pressure at a depth of 10.3 m in a swimming
pool? Does the atmospheric pressure on the water’s surface affect the pressure
below? The answer is yes. This seems only logical, since both the water’s weight
and the atmosphere’s weight must be supported. So the *total* pressure at a
depth of 10.3 m is 2 atm—half from the water above and half from the air above.
We shall see in [Pascal’s Principle](../contents//ch11PascalsPrinciple) that fluid pressures
always add in this way.

### Section Summary

* Pressure is the weight of the fluid $$mg $$ divided by the area $$A $$
  supporting it (the area of the bottom of the container):

  <div class="equation" >
   $$P=\frac{mg}{A}. $$
  </div>
* Pressure due to the weight of a liquid is given by
  <div class="equation" >
  $$P=h \rho g, $$
  </div>
    where  $$P $$ is the pressure,  $$h $$ is the height of the liquid,  $$\rho  $$
    is the density of the liquid, and  $$g $$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

### What is Power?

*Power*—the word conjures up many images: a professional football player
muscling aside his opponent, a dragster roaring away from the starting line, a
volcano blowing its lava into the atmosphere, or a rocket blasting off, as
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2523817).

![A space shuttle rocket is being launched and is burning propellant.](../resources/Figure_08_07_01a.jpg "This powerful rocket on the Space Shuttle Endeavor did work and consumed energy at a very high rate. (credit: NASA)")
{: #import-auto-id2523817}

These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent
with the scientific definition of **power**{: data-type="term"} ( $$ P $$
) as the rate at which work is done.

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Power
</div>
Power is the rate at which work is done.

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ P=\frac{W}{t} $$ 
</div>
The SI unit for power is the **watt**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1485594} ( $$ W $$ 

), where 1 watt equals 1 joule/second $$ \left(1 \text{W}=1 J/s\right)\text{.}
$$
</div>

Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is
expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example, expends 60 J of energy per second.
Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time.
For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of
work and consumes a large amount of fuel in a short time.

### Calculating Power from Energy

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Calculating the Power to Climb Stairs
</div>
What is the power output for a 60.0-kg woman who runs up a 3.00 m high flight of stairs in 3.50 s, starting from rest but having a final speed of 2.00 m/s? (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2265354).)

![A woman is standing before a set of stairs with her weight shown by a vector w pointing vertically downward, which is equal to m times g. The normal force N acting on the woman is shown by a vector pointing vertically upward, which is equal to negative w. Her velocity at this point is v sub 0 equal to zero. She runs and reaches the top of the stairs at a height h with velocity v sub f. Now she possesses potential energy as well as kinetic energy labeled as K E plus P E sub g.](../resources/Figure_08_07_02a.jpg "When this woman runs upstairs starting from rest, she converts the chemical energy originally from food into kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. Her power output depends on how fast she does this. ")
{: #import-auto-id2265354}

**Strategy and Concept**

The work going into mechanical energy is $$ W=\text{KE} + \text{PE} $$. At the
bottom of the stairs, we take both $$ \text{KE} $$ and $$ \text{PE}_{g} $$ as
initially zero; thus, $$ W=\text{KE}_{f}+\text{PE}_{g}=\frac{1}{2} m v_
{f}^{2}+mgh $$, where $$ h $$ is the vertical height of the stairs. Because all
terms are given, we can calculate $$ W $$ and then divide it by time to get
power.

**Solution**

Substituting the expression for $$ W $$ into the definition of power given in
the previous equation, $$ P=W/t $$ yields

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}+mgh }{t}\text{.} $$ 
</div>
Entering known values yields

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}P& =& \frac{0.5\left(60.0 \text{kg}\right){\left(2.00 \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}+\left(60.0 \text{kg}\right)\left( 9.80 \text{ m/s}^{2}\right)\left(3.00 \text{m}\right)}{3.50 \text{s}}\\ & =& \frac{120 \text{J}+1764 \text{J}}{3.50 \text{s}}\\ & =& 538 \text{W.}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

The woman does 1764 J of work to move up the stairs compared with only 120 J to
increase her kinetic energy; thus, most of her power output is required for
climbing rather than accelerating.

</div>

It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than
1 **horsepower**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1522337} $$ \left(1
\text{hp}=746 \text{W}\right) $$
! People can generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short
periods of time by rapidly converting available blood sugar and oxygen into work
output. (A horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted,
power output decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen
to metabolize more food—this is known as the *aerobic* stage of exercise. If the
woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be much less,
although the amount of work done would be the same.

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Measure Your Power Rating
</div>
Determine your own power rating by measuring the time it takes you to climb a flight of stairs. We will ignore the gain in kinetic energy, as the above example showed that it was a small portion of the energy gain. Don’t expect that your output will be more than about 0.5 hp.

</div>

### Examples of Power

Examples of power are limited only by the imagination, because there are as many
types as there are forms of work and energy. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2195139) for some examples.) Sunlight reaching
Earth’s surface carries a maximum power of about 1.3 kilowatts per square meter
$$ \left({\text{kW/m}}^{2}\right)\text{.} $$ A tiny fraction of this is retained
by Earth over the long term. Our consumption rate of fossil fuels is far greater
than the rate at which they are stored, so it is inevitable that they will be
depleted. Power implies that energy is transferred, perhaps changing form. It is
never possible to change one form completely into another without losing some of
it as thermal energy. For example, a 60-W incandescent bulb converts only 5 W of
electrical power to light, with 55 W dissipating into thermal energy.
Furthermore, the typical electric power plant converts only 35 to 40% of its
fuel into electricity. The remainder becomes a huge amount of thermal energy
that must be dispersed as heat transfer, as rapidly as it is created. A
coal-fired power plant may produce 1000 megawatts; 1 megawatt (MW) is $$
10^{6}\text{W} $$ of electric power. But the power plant consumes chemical
energy at a rate of about 2500 MW, creating heat transfer to the surroundings at
a rate of 1500 MW. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1844080).)

![A distant view of a coal-fired power plant with clearly visible cooling towers generating electric power and emitting a large amount of gases.](../resources/Figure_08_07_03a.jpg "Tremendous amounts of electric power are generated by coal-fired power plants such as this one in China, but an even larger amount of power goes into heat transfer to the surroundings. The large cooling towers here are needed to transfer heat as rapidly as it is produced. The transfer of heat is not unique to coal plants but is an unavoidable consequence of generating electric power from any fuel&#x2014;nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, or the like.

### Power and Energy Consumption

We usually have to pay for the energy we use. It is interesting and easy to
estimate the cost of energy for an electrical appliance if its power consumption
rate and time used are known. The higher the power consumption rate and the
longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance. The power
consumption rate is $$ P=W/t=E/t $$, where $$ E $$ is the energy supplied by the
electricity company. So the energy consumed over a time $$ t $$ is

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ E=\text{Pt.} $$ 
</div>

Electricity bills state the energy used in units of **kilowatt-hours**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id1733623} $$ \left(\text{kW}\cdot h\right), $$
which is the product of power in kilowatts and time in hours. This unit is
convenient because electrical power consumption at the kilowatt level for hours
at a time is typical.

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Calculating Energy Costs
</div>
What is the cost of running a 0.200-kW computer 6.00 h per day for 30.0 d 
if the cost of electricity is  $$ 0.120 \$ \text{per kW}\cdot h $$ 

?

**Strategy**

Cost is based on energy consumed; thus, we must find $$ E $$ from $$ E=\text{Pt}
$$ and then calculate the cost. Because electrical energy is expressed in $$
\text{kW}\cdot h $$, at the start of a problem such as this it is convenient to
convert the units into $$ \text{kW} $$ and hours.

**Solution**

The energy consumed in $$ \text{kW}\cdot \text{h} $$ is

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}E& =& \text{Pt}=\left(0.200\text{kW}\right)\left(6.00\text{h/d}\right)\left(30.0\text{d}\right)\\ & =
&36.0 \text{kW}\cdot \text{h,}\end{array} $$ 
</div>
and the cost is simply given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-110">
 $$ \text{cost}=\left(36.0 \text{kW}\cdot h\right)\left($0.120 `per kW\cdot h\right)=$4.32 per month. $$ 
</div>
**Discussion**

The cost of using the computer in this example is neither exorbitant nor
negligible. It is clear that the cost is a combination of power and time. When
both are high, such as for an air conditioner in the summer, the cost is high.

</div>

The motivation to save energy has become more compelling with its
ever-increasing price. Armed with the knowledge that energy consumed is the
product of power and time, you can estimate costs for yourself and make the
necessary value judgments about where to save energy. Either power or time must
be reduced. It is most cost-effective to limit the use of high-power devices
that normally operate for long periods of time, such as water heaters and air
conditioners. This would not include relatively high power devices like
toasters, because they are on only a few minutes per day. It would also not
include electric clocks, in spite of their 24-hour-per-day usage, because they
are very low power devices. It is sometimes possible to use devices that have
greater efficiencies—that is, devices that consume less power to accomplish the
same task. One example is the compact fluorescent light bulb, which produces
over four times more light per watt of power consumed than its incandescent
cousin.

Modern civilization depends on energy, but current levels of energy consumption
and production are not sustainable. The likelihood of a link between global
warming and fossil fuel use (with its concomitant production of carbon dioxide),
has made reduction in energy use as well as a shift to non-fossil fuels of the
utmost importance. Even though energy in an isolated system is a conserved
quantity, the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer
to the environment, which is no longer useful for doing work. As we will discuss
in more detail in [Thermodynamics](/contents/m42231), the potential for energy
to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation.

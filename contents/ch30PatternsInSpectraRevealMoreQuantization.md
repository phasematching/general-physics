High-resolution measurements of atomic and molecular spectra show that the
spectral lines are even more complex than they first appear. In this section, we
will see that this complexity has yielded important new information about
electrons and their orbits in atoms.

In order to explore the substructure of atoms (and knowing that magnetic fields
affect moving charges), the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1930)
suggested that his student Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943) study how spectra might be
affected by magnetic fields. What they found became known as the **Zeeman
effect**, which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate
emission lines by an external magnetic field, as shown in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1)
. For their discoveries, Zeeman and Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in
Physics.

Zeeman splitting is complex. Some lines split into three lines, some into five,
and so on. But one general feature is that the amount the split lines are
separated is proportional to the applied field strength, indicating an
interaction with a moving charge. The splitting means that the quantized energy
of an orbit is affected by an external magnetic field, causing the orbit to have
several discrete energies instead of one. Even without an external magnetic
field, very precise measurements showed that spectral lines are doublets (split
into two), apparently by magnetic fields within the atom itself.

![The figure shows the effect of magnetic field on spectral lines. In the first case, two spectral lines are shown when there is no external magnetic field. In the second case, when magnetic field is applied, the spectral lines split into several lines; the line on the left splits into three lines. The line on the right splits into five. In the third case, the magnetic field is large. The left line is again split into three lines and the right into five, but the split lines are farther apart than they are when the external magnetic field is not as strong.](../resources/Figure_30_07_00a.jpg "The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines when a magnetic field is applied. The number of lines formed varies, but the spread is proportional to the strength of the applied field. (a) Two spectral lines with no external magnetic field. (b) The lines split when the field is applied. (c) The splitting is greater when a stronger field is applied.")

Bohr’s theory of circular orbits is useful for visualizing how an electron’s
orbit is affected by a magnetic field. The circular orbit forms a current loop,
which creates a magnetic field of its own, $${\vb{B}}_{\text{orb}} $$ as
seen in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). Note that the **orbital magnetic field**
$${\vb{B}}_{\text{orb}} $$ and the **orbital angular momentum**
$${\vb{L}}_{\text{orb}} $$ are along the same line. The external magnetic
field and the orbital magnetic field interact; a torque is exerted to align
them. A torque rotating a system through some angle does work so that there is
energy associated with this interaction. Thus, orbits at different angles to the
external magnetic field have different energies. What is remarkable is that the
energies are quantized—the magnetic field splits the spectral lines into several
discrete lines that have different energies. This means that only certain angles
are allowed between the orbital angular momentum and the external field, as seen
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

![The figure shows an electron traveling in a circular orbit with radius r. A magnetic field B sub orb is oriented downwards and the orbital angular momentum L sub orb is oriented along the same line but upward, in a direction opposite B sub orb.](../resources/Figure_30_07_01a.jpg "The approximate picture of an electron in a circular orbit illustrates how the current loop produces its own magnetic field, called \( B_\text{orb} \). It also shows how \( B_\text{orb} \) is along the same line as the orbital angular momentum \( L_\text{orb} \).")

![An external magnetic field along vertical z-axis is shown. Several spectral lines are shown originating from the same point on the z-axis which represents orbital angular momentum.](../resources/Figure_30_07_02a.jpg "Only certain angles are allowed between the orbital angular momentum and an external magnetic field. This is implied by the fact that the Zeeman effect splits spectral lines into several discrete lines. Each line is associated with an angle between the external magnetic field and magnetic fields due to electrons and their orbits.")

We already know that the magnitude of angular momentum is quantized for electron
orbits in atoms. The new insight is that the *direction of the orbital angular
momentum is also quantized*. The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have
only certain directions is called **space quantization**. Like many aspects of
quantum mechanics, this quantization of direction is totally unexpected. On the
macroscopic scale, orbital angular momentum, such as that of the moon around the
earth, can have any magnitude and be in any direction.

Detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of
atomic spectra, but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else. As
mentioned, spectral lines are actually closely spaced doublets, a characteristic
called **fine structure**, as shown in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). The doublet
changes when a magnetic field is applied, implying that whatever causes the
doublet interacts with a magnetic field. In 1925, Sem Goudsmit and George
Uhlenbeck, two Dutch physicists, successfully argued that electrons have
properties analogous to a macroscopic charge spinning on its axis. Electrons, in
fact, have an internal or intrinsic angular momentum called **intrinsic spin**
$$\vb{S} $$ .
Since electrons are charged, their intrinsic spin creates
an **intrinsic magnetic
field** $${\vb{B}}_{\text{int}} $$ , which interacts with
their orbital magnetic field $${\vb{B}}_{\text{orb}} $$ .
Furthermore, *electron* **intrinsic spin** is quantized in magnitude and
direction*, analogous to the situation for orbital angular momentum. The spin of
the electron can have only one magnitude, and its direction can be at only one
of two angles relative to a magnetic field, as seen in [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).
We refer to this as spin up or spin down for the electron. Each spin direction
has a different energy; hence, spectroscopic lines are split into two. Spectral
doublets are now understood as being due to electron spin.

![Image a shows a magnified view of two spectral lines. The magnified view shows that these spectral lines are doublets, which means two parallel lines being placed together. In image b a structure in which concentric waves are expanding out is shown.](../resources/Figure_30_07_03a1.jpg "Fine structure. Upon close examination, spectral lines are doublets, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The electron has an intrinsic magnetic field that interacts with its orbital magnetic field.")
{ #Figure4}

![The image shows two cases of intrinsic magnetic field of an electron due to its spin. In the first case, circular orbit is shown with external magnetic field in the vertical direction and the direction of the intrinsic magnetic field of electron due to its spin is upwards at an angle of fifty four point seven degrees with the vertical axis. In the second case, circular orbit is shown with external magnetic field in the vertical direction and the direction of the intrinsic magnetic field of electron due to its spin is downwards at an angle of fifty four point seven degrees with the vertical axis.](../resources/Figure_30_07_04a.jpg "The intrinsic magnetic field \( B_\text{int} \) of an electron is attributed to its spin, \( S \) , roughly pictured to be due to its charge spinning on its axis. This is only a crude model, since electrons seem to have no size. The spin and intrinsic magnetic field of the electron can make only one of two angles with another magnetic field, such as that created by the electron&#x2019;s orbital motion. Space is quantized for spin as well as for orbital angular momentum.")
{ #Figure5}

These two new insights—that the direction of angular momentum, whether orbital
or spin, is quantized, and that electrons have intrinsic spin—help to explain
many of the complexities of atomic and molecular spectra. In magnetic resonance
imaging, it is the way that the intrinsic magnetic field of hydrogen and
biological atoms interact with an external field that underlies the diagnostic
fundamentals.

### Section Summary

* The Zeeman effect—the splitting of lines when a magnetic field is applied—is
  caused by other quantized entities in atoms.
* Both the magnitude and direction of orbital angular momentum are quantized.
* The same is true for the magnitude and direction of the intrinsic spin of
  electrons.

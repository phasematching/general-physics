* Make reasonable approximations based on given data.

</div>

On many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make
**approximations** or “guesstimates”
for a particular quantity. What is the distance to a certain destination? What
is the approximate density of a given item? About how large a current will there
be in a circuit? Many approximate numbers are based on formulae in which the
input quantities are known only to a limited accuracy. As you develop
problem-solving skills (that can be applied to a variety of fields through a
study of physics), you will also develop skills at approximating. You will
develop these skills through thinking more quantitatively, and by being willing
to take risks. As with any endeavor, experience helps, as well as familiarity
with units. These approximations allow us to rule out certain scenarios or
unrealistic numbers. Approximations also allow us to challenge others and guide
us in our approaches to our scientific world. Let us do two examples to
illustrate this concept.

Approximate the Height of a Building
</div>
Can you approximate the height of one of the buildings on your campus, or in your neighborhood? Let us make an approximation based upon the height of a person. In this example, we will calculate the height of a 39-story building.

**Strategy**

Think about the average height of an adult male. We can approximate the height
of the building by scaling up from the height of a person.

**Solution**

Based on information in the example, we know there are 39 stories in the
building. If we use the fact that the height of one story is approximately equal
to about the length of two adult humans (each human is about 2-m tall), then we
can estimate the total height of the building to be

<div class="equation">
 $$ \frac{2 \m }{1 \text{person}}×\frac{2 \text{person}}{1 \text{story}}× 39\text{stories}
= 156 \m . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

You can use known quantities to determine an approximate measurement of unknown
quantities. If your hand measures 10 cm across, how many hand lengths equal the
width of your desk? What other measurements can you approximate besides length?

Approximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars
</div>
![A bank stack containing one hundred hundred-dollar bills.](../resources/Figure_01_04_01.jpg "A bank stack contains one-hundred $100 bills, and is worth $10 000. How many bank stacks make up a trillion dollars? (credit: Andrew Magill)"){: #import-auto-id2966692}

The U.S. federal deficit in the 2019 fiscal year was a little greater than $ 1
trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much even one trillion
actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $100 bills. If
you made 100-bill stacks and used them to evenly cover a football field (between
the end zones), make an approximation of how high the money pile would become. (
We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are
measured in yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft.
What do you think?

**Strategy**

When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks
of 100 wrapped $100 bills, such as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since
this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the
volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion
dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field
multiplied by the unknown height.

**Solution**

(1) Calculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single
bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A stack of 100 of these is about 0.5 in.
thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{}
\text{volume of stack}=\text{length}×\text{width}×\text{height,}\\
\text{volume of stack}=6 \text{in.}×3 \text{in.}\times 0.5 \text{in.},\\
\text{volume of stack}=9 \text{in.}^{3} .
\end{array} $$
</div>
(2) Calculate the number of stacks. Note that a trillion dollars is equal to $$ $1\times 10^{12}, $$
and a stack of one-hundred $$ $100 $$ bills is equal to $$ $10 000, $$
or $$ $1\times 10^{4} $$. The number of stacks you will have is:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \$1 \times 10^{12}
\left( \text{a trillion dollars} \right)
 1 \times 10^{4} \$ \text{per stack}=1\times 10^{8}\text{stacks.} $$
</div>
(3) Calculate the area of a football field in square inches. The area of a football field is
$$ 100 \text{yd} \times 50 \text{yd,} $$
which gives $$ 5000 \text{yd}^{2}. $$
Because we are working in inches, we need to convert square yards to square
inches:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{}
\text{Area}=5 000 \text{yd}^{2}×\frac{3\text{ft}}{1 \text{yd}} \times
\frac{3\text{ft}}{1 \text{yd}} \times \frac{12 \text{in.}}{1 \text{ft}}
\times \frac{12 \text{in.}}{1 \text{ft}}=6 480 000\text{in.}^{2},\\
\text{Area} \approx 6\times 10^{6} \text{in.}^{2}.
\end{array} $$
</div>
This conversion gives us $$ 6\times 10^{6}\text{in.}^{2} $$
for the area of the field. (Note that we are using only one significant figure
in these calculations.)

(4) Calculate the total volume of the bills. The volume of all the $$ $100 $$ -bill
stacks is $$ 9\text{in.}^{3}/\text{stack}\times 10^{8}\text{
stacks}=9\times 10^{8}\text{in.}^{3}. $$

(5) Calculate the height. To determine the height of the bills, use the
equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{volume of bills}&=& \text{area of field}×\text{height of money:}\\
\text{Height of money}&=& \frac{ \text{volume of bills}}{\text{area of field}},\\
\text{Height of money}&=& \frac{9\times 10^{8}\text{in.}^{3}}{6\times 10^{6}{\text{in.}}^{2}}=1.33\times 10^{2}\text{in.,}\\
\text{Height of money}& \approx & 1\times 10^{2}\text{in.}=100 \text{in.}
\end{array} $$
</div>
The height of the money will be about 100 in. high. Converting this value to feet gives

<div class="equation">
 $$ 100 \text{in.}×\frac{1 \text{ft}}{12 \text{in.}}=8.33 \text{ft}\approx 8 \text{ft.} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

The final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but
the other early estimate of 10 ft (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the
approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you in
terms of rough “guesstimates” versus carefully calculated approximations?

Just by using our intuition, we can begin to see how rotational quantities like
$$ \theta $$, $$ \omega $$, and $$ \alpha $$ are related to one another. For
example, if a motorcycle wheel has a large angular acceleration for a fairly
long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many revolutions. In
more technical terms, if the wheel’s angular acceleration $$ \alpha $$ is large
for a long period of time $$ t $$, then the final angular velocity $$ \omega $$
and angle of rotation $$ \theta $$ are large. The wheel’s rotational motion is
exactly analogous to the fact that the motorcycle’s large translational
acceleration produces a large final velocity, and the distance traveled will
also be large.

Kinematics is the description of motion. The **kinematics of rotational motion**
{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3025215} describes the relationships among
rotation angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and

time. Let us start by finding an equation relating $$ \omega $$, $$ \alpha $$,
and $$ t $$. To determine this equation, we recall a familiar kinematic equation
for translational, or straight-line, motion:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-580">
 $$ v=v_{0}+ at \left(\text{constant } a\right) $$ 
</div>

Note that in rotational motion $$ a= a_{\text{t}} $$, and we shall use the
symbol $$ a $$ for tangential or linear acceleration from now on. As in linear
kinematics, we assume $$ a $$ is constant, which means that angular acceleration
$$ \alpha $$ is also a constant, because $$ a= r\alpha $$. Now, let us
substitute $$ v=r \omega $$ and $$ a= r\alpha $$ into the linear equation above:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-343">
 $$ r \omega =r \omega_{0}+ r\alpha t . $$ 
</div>

The radius $$ r $$ cancels in the equation, yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-323">
 $$ \omega =\omega_{0} +a t \left(\text{constant } a\right), $$ 
</div>

where $$ \omega_{0} $$ is the initial angular velocity. This last equation is
a *kinematic relationship* among $$ \omega $$, $$ \alpha $$, and $$ t $$ —that
is, it describes their relationship without reference to forces or masses that
may affect rotation. It is also precisely analogous in form to its translational
counterpart.

Making Connections
</div>
Kinematics for rotational motion is completely analogous to translational kinematics, first presented in [One-Dimensional Kinematics](/contents/m42122). Kinematics is concerned with the description of motion without regard to force or mass. We will find that translational kinematic quantities, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration have direct analogs in rotational motion.

</div>

Starting with the four kinematic equations we developed
in [One-Dimensional Kinematics](/contents/m42122), we can derive the 
following four rotational kinematic equations (presented together with their translational counterparts):

##### Table: Rotational Kinematic Equations

|Rotational|Translational| Conditions|
|--- |--- |--- |
| $$\theta= \overline{\omega} t $$| $$ x = \overline{v} t $$ | |
| $$\omega=\omega_0 + \alpha t $$ | $$v = v_0 + a t $$ | constant $$\alpha$$, constant $$a$$ |
| $$\theta=\omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 $$ | $$ x = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$ | constant $$\alpha$$, constant $$a$$ |
| $$\omega^2= \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha \theta $$ | $$ v^2 =v_0^2 + 2 a x $$ | constant $$\alpha$$, constant $$a$$ |
{: #import-auto-id3400476}

In these equations, the subscript 0 denotes initial values 
($$ \theta_{0} $$, $$ x_{0} $$, and $$ t_{0} $$ are initial values), 
and the average angular velocity $$ \overline{\omega } $$ 
and average velocity $$ \overline{v} $$ are defined as follows:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-900">
 $$ \overline{\omega }=\frac{ \omega_{0} +\omega }{2}; \overline{v}=\frac{ v_
{0}+v}{2} . $$ 
</div>

The equations given above in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3400476) can be used to
solve any rotational or translational kinematics problem in which $$ a $$ and $$
\alpha $$ are constant.

<div data-type="title">
Calculating the Acceleration of a Fishing Reel
</div>
A deep-sea fisherman hooks a big fish that swims away from the boat pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel. The whole system is initially at rest and the fishing line unwinds from the reel at a radius of 4.50 cm from its axis of rotation. The reel is given an angular acceleration of $$ 110 \radss $$ 

for 2.00 s as seen in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2953309).

(a) What is the final angular velocity of the reel?

(b) At what speed is fishing line leaving the reel after 2.00 s elapses?

(c) How many revolutions does the reel make?

(d) How many meters of fishing line come off the reel in this time?

**Strategy**

In each part of this example, the strategy is the same as it was for solving
problems in linear kinematics. In particular, known values are identified and a
relationship is then sought that can be used to solve for the unknown.

**Solution for (a)**

Here $$ \alpha $$ and $$ t $$ are given and $$ \omega $$ needs to be determined.
The most straightforward equation to use is $$ \omega =\omega_{0} +\alpha t $$
because the unknown is already on one side and all other terms are known. That
equation states that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-826">
 $$ \omega =\omega_{0} +\alpha t . $$ 
</div>
We are also given that $$ \omega_{0} =0 $$ 
(it starts from rest), so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-74">
 $$ \omega =0+\left( 110 \radss \right)\left(2.00\s \right
=220\rads . $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Now that $$ \omega $$ is known, the speed $$ v $$ can most easily be found using the relationship

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-825">
 $$ v=r \omega , $$ 
</div>
where the radius $$ r $$ of the reel is given to be 4.50 cm; thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-147">
 $$ v=\left(0.0450 \m \right)\left(220 \rads \right)=9.90 \ms . $$ 
</div>
Note again that radians must always be used in any calculation relating linear and angular quantities. Also, because radians are dimensionless, we have $$ \m ×\text{rad}=\m $$.

**Solution for (c)**

Here, we are asked to find the number of revolutions. Because $$ 1 \text{rev}=2
\pi \text{rad} $$, we can find the number of revolutions by finding $$ \theta $$
in radians. We are given $$ \alpha $$ and $$ t $$, and we know $$ \omega_{0} $$
is zero, so that $$ \theta $$ can be obtained using $$ \theta =\omega_{0}
t+\frac{1}{2} \alpha t^{2} $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-252">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\theta & =& \omega_{0} t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^{2}\\
 & =& 0+\left(0.500\right)\left(110 \radss \right){\left(2.00 \s \right)}^{2}=220 \text{rad}.
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
Converting radians to revolutions gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-689">
 $$ \theta =\left(220 \text{rad}\right)\frac{1 \text{rev}}{2 \pi \text{rad}}
=35.0 \text{rev} . $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (d)**

The number of meters of fishing line is $$ x $$, which
can be obtained through its relationship with $$ \theta $$:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-665">
 $$ x=r\theta\left(0.0450 \m \right)\left(220 \text{rad}\right)=9.90 \m . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This example illustrates that relationships among rotational quantities are
highly analogous to those among linear quantities. We also see in this example
how linear and rotational quantities are connected. The answers to the questions
are realistic. After unwinding for two seconds, the reel is found to spin at 220
rad/s, which is 2100 rpm. (No wonder reels sometimes make high-pitched sounds.)
The amount of fishing line played out is 9.90 m, about right for when the big
fish bites.

</div>

![The figure shows a fishing reel, with radius equal to 4.5 centimeters. The direction of rotation of the reel is counterclockwise. The rotational quantities are theta, omega and alpha, and x, v, a are linear or translational quantities. The reel, fishing line, and the direction of motion have been separately indicated by curved arrows pointing toward those parts.](../resources/Figure_11_02_01a.jpg "Fishing line coming off a rotating reel moves linearly.

<div data-type="title">
Calculating the Duration When the Fishing Reel Slows Down and Stops
</div>
Now let us consider what happens if the fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, achieving an angular acceleration of $$ –300 \radss $$ 
. How long does it take the reel to come to a stop?

**Strategy**

We are asked to find the time $$ t $$ for the reel to come to a stop. The
initial and final conditions are different from those in the previous problem,
which involved the same fishing reel. Now we see that the initial angular
velocity is $$ \omega_{0}=220 \rads $$ and the final angular velocity $$
\omega $$ is zero. The angular acceleration is given to be $$ \alpha =-300
\radss $$. Examining the available equations, we see all quantities
but *t* are known in $$ \omega =\omega_{0}+ \alpha t, $$ making it easiest to
use this equation.

**Solution**

The equation states

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-736">
 $$ \omega =\omega_{0}+ \alpha t . $$ 
</div>
We solve the equation algebraically for *t*, and then substitute the known values as usual, yielding

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-309">
 $$ t=\frac{ \omega -\omega_{0} }{\alpha }=\frac{0-220 \rads }
{-300 \radss }=0.733 \s  . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

Note that care must be taken with the signs that indicate the directions of
various quantities. Also, note that the time to stop the reel is fairly small
because the acceleration is rather large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because
of the accelerations involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while
before applying brakes on the reel. A tired fish will be slower, requiring a
smaller acceleration.

Calculating the Slow Acceleration of Trains and Their Wheels
</div>
Large freight trains accelerate very slowly. Suppose one such train accelerates from rest, giving its 0.350-m-radius wheels an angular acceleration of $$ 0.250 \radss $$. After the wheels have made 200 revolutions (assume no slippage): 
(a) How far has the train moved down the track?
(b) What are the final angular velocity of the wheels and the linear velocity of the train?

**Strategy**

In part (a), we are asked to find $$ x $$, and in (b) we are asked to find $$
\omega $$ and $$ v $$. We are given the number of revolutions $$ \theta $$, the
radius of the wheels $$ r $$, and the angular acceleration $$ \alpha $$.

**Solution for (a)**

The distance $$ x $$ is very easily found from the relationship between distance
and rotation angle:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-36">
 $$ \theta =\frac{x}{r}. $$ 
</div>
Solving this equation for $$ x $$ 

yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-53">
 $$ x=r\theta . $$ 
</div>
Before using this equation, we must convert the number of revolutions into radians, because we are dealing with a relationship between linear and rotational quantities:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-915">
 $$ \theta =\left(200\text{rev}\right)\frac{2\pi \text{rad}}{1 \text{rev}}=1257\text{rad}. $$ 
</div>
Now we can substitute the known values into $$ x= r\theta $$ 
to find the distance the train moved down the track:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-271">
 $$ x= r\theta =\left(0.350 m\right)\left(1257 \text{rad}\right)=440 \m . $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

We cannot use any equation that incorporates $$ t $$ to find $$ \omega $$,
because the equation would have at least two unknown values. The equation $$
\omega^{2}=\omega_{0}^{2}+2 \alpha \theta $$ will work, because we know the
values for all variables except $$ \omega $$:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-401">
 $$ \omega^{2}=\omega_{0}^{2}+2 \alpha \theta $$ 
</div>
Taking the square root of this equation and entering the known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-6">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\omega & =& {\left[ 0+ 2\left(0.250 \radss \right)
\left(1257 \text{rad}\right)\right]}^{1/2} \\
 & =& 25.1 \text{rad/s.}
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
We can find the linear velocity of the train, $$ v $$,
through its relationship to $$ \omega $$:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-84">
 $$ v=r \omega =\left(0.350 m\right)\left(25.1 \rads \right)=8.77 \ms . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

The distance traveled is fairly large and the final velocity is fairly slow (just under 32 km/h).

</div>

There is translational motion even for something spinning in place, as the
following example illustrates. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2409927) shows a fly on
the edge of a rotating microwave oven plate. The example below calculates the
total distance it travels.

![The figure shows a fly that has landed on the rotating plate of the microwave. The direction of rotation of the plate, omega, is counterclockwise and is shown with an arrow.](../resources/Figure_11_02_02a.jpg "The image shows a microwave plate. The fly makes revolutions while the food is heated (along with the fly).")

Calculating the Distance Traveled by a Fly on the Edge of a Microwave Oven Plate
</div>
A person decides to use a microwave oven to reheat some lunch. In the process, a fly accidentally flies into the microwave and lands on the outer edge of the rotating plate and remains there. If the plate has a radius of 0.15 m and rotates at 6.0 rpm, calculate the total distance traveled by the fly during a 2.0-min cooking period. (Ignore the start-up and slow-down times.)

**Strategy**

First, find the total number of revolutions $$ \theta $$, and then the linear
distance $$ x $$ traveled. $$ \theta =\overline{\omega }t $$ can be used to find
$$ \theta $$ because $$ \overline{\omega } $$ is given to be 6.0 rpm.

**Solution**

Entering known values into $$ \theta =\overline{\omega }t $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-477">
 $$ \theta =\overline{\omega} t=\left(6.0 \text{rpm}\right)\left(2.0 \text{min}\right)=12 \text{rev}. $$ 
</div>
As always, it is necessary to convert revolutions to radians before 
calculating a linear quantity like $$ x $$ from an angular quantity like $$ \theta $$:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-745">
 $$ \theta =\left(12 \text{rev}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi \text{rad}}{1 \text
{rev}}\right)=75.4\text{rad.} $$ 
</div>
Now, using the relationship between $$ x $$ 
and $$ \theta $$, we can determine the distance traveled:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-624">
 $$ x=r \theta =\left(0.15\m \right)\left(75.4\text{rad}\right)
=11\m . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

Quite a trip (if it survives)! Note that this distance is the total distance
traveled by the fly. Displacement is actually zero for complete revolutions
because they bring the fly back to its original position. The distinction
between total distance traveled and displacement was first noted
in [One-Dimensional Kinematics](/contents/m42122).

The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered
examples of **thermal expansion**, the change in size or volume of a given mass
with temperature. Hot air rises because its volume increases, which causes the
hot air’s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a
buoyant (upward) force on the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and
gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and weather
systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for
example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with
temperature changes.

What are the basic properties of thermal expansion? First, thermal expansion is
clearly related to temperature change. The greater the temperature change, the
more a bimetallic strip will bend. Second, it depends on the material. In a
thermometer, for example, the expansion of alcohol is much greater than the
expansion of the glass containing it.

What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As is discussed
in [Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature](../contents/ch13KineticTheory.md)
, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the
individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are
closely packed together, but their kinetic energy (in the form of small, rapid
vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This
neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average,
between neighbors, and adds up to a larger size for the whole body. For most
substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and an
increase in temperature will increase the solid’s size by a certain fraction in
each dimension.

Linear Thermal Expansion—Thermal Expansion in One Dimension
</div>
The change in length  $$\Delta L $$  is proportional to length  $$L $$ .
 The dependence of thermal expansion on temperature, substance, and length is summarized in the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T, $$
</div>
where  $$\Delta L $$
 is the change in length  $$L $$,  $$\Delta T $$
 is the change in temperature, and  $$\alpha  $$  is the **coefficient of linear expansion**, which varies slightly with temperature.

</div>

[[Table 1]](#Table1) lists representative values of the coefficient of linear
expansion, which may have units of $$1/\text{ºC} $$ or 1/K. Because the size of
a kelvin and a degree Celsius are the same, both $$\alpha $$ and $$\Delta T $$
can be expressed in units of kelvins or degrees Celsius. The equation $$\Delta
L=\alpha L\Delta T $$ is accurate for small changes in temperature and can be
used for large changes in temperature if an average value of $$\alpha $$ is
used.

Calculating Linear Thermal Expansion: The Golden Gate Bridge
</div>
The main span of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge is 1275 m long at its coldest. The bridge is exposed to temperatures ranging from  $$-15\text{ºC} $$
 to  $$40\text{ºC} $$ .
 What is its change in length between these temperatures? Assume that the bridge is made entirely of steel.

**Strategy**

Use the equation for linear thermal expansion $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T $$ to
calculate the change in length , $$\Delta L $$ . Use the coefficient of linear
expansion, $$\alpha $$ , for steel from [[Table 1]](#Table1), and note that the
change in temperature, $$\Delta T $$ , is $$55\text{ºC} $$.

**Solution**

Plug all of the known values into the equation to solve for $$\Delta L $$.

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T=\left(\frac{12 \times 10^{-6} }{\text{ºC}}\right)\left(1275 \text{m}\right)\left(55\text{ºC}\right)=0.84 \text{m} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Although not large compared with the length of the bridge, this change in length
is observable. It is generally spread over many expansion joints so that the
expansion at each joint is small.

</div>

### Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions

Objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). That
is, their areas and volumes, as well as their lengths, increase with
temperature. Holes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a
metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the plug
was still in place. The plug would get bigger, and so the hole must get bigger
too. (Think of the ring of neighboring atoms or molecules on the wall of the
hole as pushing each other farther apart as temperature increases. Obviously,
the ring of neighbors must get slightly larger, so the hole gets slightly
larger).

<div class="title">
Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions
</div>
For small temperature changes, the change in area  $$\Delta A $$
 is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta A=2\alpha A\Delta T, $$
</div>
where  $$\Delta A $$  is the change in area  $$A $$ ,
  $$\Delta T $$
 is the change in temperature, and  $$\alpha  $$
 is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.

Part b shows the outline of a flat metal plate with a hole in it, before and after expansion. The hole expands. Part c shows the outline of a rectangular box before and after expansion. After expansion, the box has the same proportions as before expansion, but it has a greater volume.](../resources/Figure_13_02_02.jpg "In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the objects are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width increase. The area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing temperature, just as if the expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase.")

The change in volume  $$\Delta V $$
 is very nearly  $$\Delta V=3\alpha V\Delta T $$ .
 This equation is usually written as

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\beta V\Delta T\text{,} $$
</div>
where  $$\beta  $$  is the **coefficient of volume expansion** and  $$\beta \approx 3\alpha  $$ .
 Note that the values of  $$\beta  $$  in [[Table 1]](#Table1) are almost exactly equal to  $$3\alpha  $$.

</div>

In general, objects will expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most
important exception to this rule. Water expands with increasing temperature (its
density *decreases*) when it is at temperatures greater than $$4\text{ºC}\left(
40\text{ºF}\right) $$ . However, it expands with *decreasing* temperature when
it is between $$+4\text{ºC} $$ and $$0\text{ºC} $$  ( $$40\text{ºF} $$ to
$$32\text{ºF}$$) . Water is densest at $$+4\text{ºC} $$ .
(See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) Perhaps the most striking effect of this
phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools
down to $$4\text{ºC} $$ it is denser than the remaining water and thus will sink
to the bottom. This “turnover” results in a layer of warmer water near the
surface, which is then cooled. Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of
$$4\text{ºC} $$ . If the temperature in the surface layer drops below
$$4\text{ºC} $$ , the water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays
near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely freeze over. The ice
on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter’s harsh exterior
air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in $$4\text{ºC} $$
water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water. It also produces
circulation of water in the pond that is necessary for a healthy ecosystem of
the body of water.

At zero degrees C, the density is just under zero point nine nine nine five grams per cubic centimeter. The density then increases at a decreasing rate until it hits a peak of about zero point nine nine nine nine seven grams per cubic centimeter at about four degrees C. Above four degrees C, the density decreases with increasing temperature.](../resources/Figure_13_02_03.jpg "The density of water as a function of temperature.

Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank
</div>
Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands much more than steel, and so it may overflow.

This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the
gasoline gauge. The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the
gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The gasoline
has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on,
but because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to
getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter, beware—you will probably run
out much more quickly in the summer.

![Fuel gauge pointing to empty.](../resources/Figure_13_02_03a.jpg "Because the gas expands more than the gas tank with increasing temperature, you can&#x2019;t drive as many miles on &#x201C;empty&#x201D; in the summer as you can in the winter. (credit: Hector Alejandro, Flickr)")

Calculating Thermal Expansion: Gas vs. Gas Tank
</div>
Suppose your 60.0-L (15.9-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas, so both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of  $$ 15.0\text{ºC} $$ .
 How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$ ?

**Strategy**

The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so
the amount spilled is the difference in their volume changes. (The gasoline tank
can be treated as solid steel.) We can use the equation for volume expansion to
calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank.

**Solution**

1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of
   the steel tank:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\Delta V}_{\text{s}}={\beta }_{\text{s}}{V}_{\text{s}}\Delta T. $$
</div>
2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:

<div class="equation" >
 $${\Delta V}_{\text{gas}}={\beta }_{\text{gas}}{V}_{\text{gas}}\Delta T. $$
</div>
3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as

<div class="equation" >
 $${V}_{\text{spill}}={\Delta V}_{\text{gas}}-{\Delta V}_{\text{s}}. $$
</div>
Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are equal.)

<div class="equation" >
 $$\begin{array}{lll}{V}_{\text{spill}}& =& \left({\beta }_{\text{gas}}-{\beta }_{\text{s}}\right)V\Delta T\\ & =& \left[ \left(950-35\right) \times 10^{-6} /\text{ºC}\right]  \left( 60.0 \text{L}\right)\left( 20.0\text{ºC}\right)\\ & =&  1.10 \text{L}.\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so
striking because the gasoline and steel expand quickly. The rate of change in
thermal properties is discussed
in [Heat and Heat Transfer Methods](../contents/ch14HeatAndHeatTransfers).

If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it
leaks anyway, either around the cap or by bursting the tank. Tightly
constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids
and solids resist being compressed with extremely large forces. To avoid
rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps, which allow them to
expand and contract without stressing them.

</div>

### Thermal Stress

**Thermal stress** is created by thermal expansion or contraction (
see [Elasticity: Stress and Strain](../contents/ch5Elasticity) for a discussion of stress and
strain). Thermal stress can be destructive, such as when expanding gasoline
ruptures a tank. It can also be useful, for example, when two parts are joined
together by heating one in manufacturing, then slipping it over the other and
allowing the combination to cool. Thermal stress can explain many phenomena,
such as the weathering of rocks and pavement by the expansion of ice when it
freezes.

<div id="Example3" class="example" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Calculating Thermal Stress: Gas Pressure
</div>
What pressure would be created in the gasoline tank considered in [[Example 2]](#Example2), if the gasoline increases in temperature from  $$ 15.0\text{ºC} $$
 to  $$ 35.0\text{ºC} $$
 without being allowed to expand? ** Assume that the bulk modulus  $$B $$
 for gasoline is  $$ 1.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ .
 (For more on bulk modulus, see [Elasticity: Stress and Strain](../contents/ch5Elasticity).)

**Strategy**

To solve this problem, we must use the following equation, which relates a
change in volume $$\Delta V $$ to pressure:

<div class="equation" >
 $$\Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A}{V}_{0}, $$
</div>
where  $$F/A $$  is pressure,  $${V}_{0} $$
 is the original volume, and  $$B $$
 is the bulk modulus of the material involved. We will use the amount spilled in [[Example 2]](#Example2) as the change in volume,  $$\Delta V $$.

**Solution**

1. Rearrange the equation for calculating pressure:

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\Delta V}{ {V}_{0}}B\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Insert the known values. The bulk modulus for gasoline is  $$B= 1.00 \times 10^{9}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$ .
 In the previous example, the change in volume  $$\Delta V= 1.10 \text{L} $$
 is the amount that would spill. Here,  $${V}_{0}= 60.0 \text{L} $$
 is the original volume of the gasoline. Substituting these values into the equation, we obtain

<div class="equation" >
 $$P=\frac{1.10 \text{L}}{60.0 \text{L}}\left( 1.00 \times 10^{9}  \text{Pa}\right)= 1.83 \times 10^{7}  \text{Pa}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This pressure is about $$2500 {\text{lb/in}}^{2} $$ ,
*much* more than a gasoline tank can handle.

</div>

Forces and pressures created by thermal stress are typically as great as that in
the example above. Railroad tracks and roadways can buckle on hot days if they
lack sufficient expansion joints. (See [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).) Power lines sag
more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is
insufficient slack. Cracks open and close in plaster walls as a house warms and
cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly, because of
differential contraction and the stresses it creates. (Pyrex® is less
susceptible because of its small coefficient of thermal expansion.) Nuclear
reactor pressure vessels are threatened by overly rapid cooling, and although
none have failed, several have been cooled faster than considered desirable.
Biological cells are ruptured when foods are frozen, detracting from their
taste. Repeated thawing and freezing accentuate the damage. Even the oceans can
be affected. A significant portion of the rise in sea level that is resulting
from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of sea water.

Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most
implants need to be replaced over time because, among other things, metal does
not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings that
would allow metal-to-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has
an expansion coefficient similar to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients
are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing process lead to
cracks at the coating-metal interface.

Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can
expand differently from tooth enamel. It can give pain when eating ice cream or
having a hot drink. Cracks might occur in the filling. Metal fillings (gold,
silver, etc.) are being replaced by composite fillings (porcelain), which have
smaller coefficients of expansion, and are closer to those of teeth.

Two blocks, A and B, are made of the same material. Block A has dimensions  $$l×w×h=L×2L×L $$
 and Block B has dimensions  $$2L×2L×2L $$ .
 If the temperature changes, what is (a) the change in the volume of the two blocks, (b) the change in the cross-sectional area  $$l×w $$ ,
 and (c) the change in the height  $$h $$  of the two blocks?

![There are two rectangular blocks. Block A has its dimensions labeled length equals L, width equals two times L, height equals L. Block B has its dimensions labeled length, width, and height all equal to two times L.](../resources/Figure_13_02_04a.jpg " ")

</div>
<div class="solution"  data-print-placement="here" markdown="1">
(a) The change in volume is proportional to the original volume. Block A has a volume of  $$L×2L×L={2L}^{3}\text{.} $$  Block B has a volume of  $$2L×2L×2L={8L}^{3}, $$
 which is 4 times that of Block A. Thus the change in volume of Block B should be 4 times the change in volume of Block A.

(b) The change in area is proportional to the area. The cross-sectional area of
Block A is $$L×2L={2L}^{2}, $$ while that of Block B is $$2L×2L={4L}^{2}\text{.}
$$ Because cross-sectional area of Block B is twice that of Block A, the change
in the cross-sectional area of Block B is twice that of Block A.

(c) The change in height is proportional to the original height. Because the
original height of Block B is twice that of A, the change in the height of Block
B is twice that of Block A.

### Section Summary

* Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the size (length, area, or
  volume) of a body due to a change in temperature.
* Thermal expansion is large for gases, and relatively small, but not
  negligible, for liquids and solids.
* Linear thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta L=\alpha L\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\Delta L $$ is the change in length    $$L $$ , 
   $$\Delta T $$ is the change in temperature, and
   $$\alpha  $$ is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.
* The change in area due to thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta A=2\alpha A\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\Delta A $$ is the change in area.
* The change in volume due to thermal expansion is
  <div class="equation">
   $$\Delta V=\beta V\Delta T, $$
  </div>
     where
   $$\beta  $$ is the coefficient of volume expansion and
   $$\beta \approx 3\alpha  $$ . Thermal stress is created when thermal expansion is constrained.

Water expands significantly when it freezes: a volume increase of about 9% occurs. As a result of this expansion and because of the formation and growth of crystals as water freezes, anywhere from 10% to 30% of biological cells are burst when animal or plant material is frozen. Discuss the implications of this cell damage for the prospect of preserving human bodies by freezing so that they can be thawed at some future date when it is hoped that all diseases are curable.

Show that  $$\beta \approx 3\alpha , $$
 by calculating the change in volume  $$\Delta V $$
 of a cube with sides of length  $$L\text{.} $$
</div>
<div class="solution" markdown="1">
We know how the length changes with temperature:  $$\Delta L=\alpha L_{0}\Delta T $$ .
 Also we know that the volume of a cube is related to its length by  $$V={L}^{3} $$ ,
 so the final volume is then  $$V={V}_{0}+\Delta V={\left({L}_{0}+\Delta L\right)}^{3} $$ .
 Substituting for  $$\Delta L $$  gives

<div class="equation" >
 $$V={\left({L}_{0}+\alpha L_{0}\Delta T\right)}^{3}={L}_{0}^{3}{\left(1+\alpha \Delta T\right)}^{3}\text{.} $$
</div>
Now, because  $$\alpha \Delta T $$
 is small, we can use the binomial expansion:

<div class="equation"  data-element-type="problems-exercises">
 $$V\approx {L}_{0}^{3}\left(1+3\alpha \Delta T\right)={L}_{0}^{3}+3\alpha {L}_{0}^{3}\Delta T. $$
</div>
So writing the length terms in terms of volumes gives  $$V={V}_{0}+\Delta V\approx {V}_{0}+{3\alpha V}_{0}\Delta T, $$
 and so

<div class="equation"  data-element-type="problems-exercises">
 $$\Delta V=\beta V_{0}\Delta T\approx {3\alpha V}_{0}\Delta T, \text{ or } \beta \approx 3\alpha . $$

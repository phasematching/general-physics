Another interesting force in everyday life is the force of drag on an object
when it is moving in a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). You feel the drag force
when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your
hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to
move. You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side
goes through the air—you have decreased the area of your hand that faces the
direction of motion. Like friction, the **drag force**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id1165298930276} always opposes the motion of an object. Unlike
simple friction, the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity
of the object in that fluid. This functionality is complicated and depends upon
the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and the fluid it is in. For
most large objects such as bicyclists, cars, and baseballs not moving too
slowly, the magnitude of the drag force $$ F_{\text{D}} $$ is found to be
proportional to the square of the speed of the object. We can write this
relationship mathematically as *
$$ F_{\text{D}}\propto v^{2} $$
*. When taking into account other factors, this relationship becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-871">
$$ F_{\text{D}}=\frac{1}{2}C \rho A v^{2}, $$ 
</div>

where $$ C $$ is the drag coefficient, $$ A $$ is the area of the object facing
the fluid, and $$ \rho $$ is the density of the fluid. (Recall that density is
mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized
fashion as $$ F_{\text{D}}=b v^{2} $$, where $$ b $$
** is a constant equivalent to $$ 0.5 C \rho A $$. We have set the exponent for
these equations as 2 because, when an object is moving at high velocity through
air, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the speed.
As we shall see in a few pages on fluid dynamics, for small particles moving at
low speeds in a fluid, the exponent is equal to 1.

Athletes as well as car designers seek to reduce the drag force to lower their
race times. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298931800)). “Aerodynamic” shaping of an
automobile can reduce the drag force and so increase a car’s gas mileage.

The bobsled has an aerodynamic design and smooth runners so it can go as fast as possible.](../resources/Figure_06_02_02a.jpg "From racing cars to bobsled racers, aerodynamic shaping is crucial to achieving top speeds.

{: #import-auto-id1165298931800}

The value of the drag coefficient, $$ C $$, is determined empirically, usually
with the use of a wind tunnel. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298787035)).

![A model plane is can be seen being tested in a wind tunnel.](../resources/Figure_06_02_03a.jpg "NASA researchers test a model plane in a wind tunnel. (credit: NASA/Ames)")
{: #import-auto-id1165298787035}

The drag coefficient can depend upon velocity, but we will assume that it is a
constant here. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298535568) lists some typical drag
coefficients for a variety of objects. Notice that the drag coefficient is a
dimensionless quantity. At highway speeds, over 50% of the power of a car is
used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed is about 70–80
km/h (about 45–50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the
United States, maximum speeds on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).

Substantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize drag. The
dimples on golf balls are being redesigned as are the clothes that athletes
wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear full bodysuits.
Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and
won the gold medal for the 400 m race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing
Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might have made a difference in breaking
many world records (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298678773)). Most elite
swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair. Such innovations can have the
effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference
between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise
guidelines must be continuously developed to maintain the integrity of the
sport.

The seams of the suit are ultrasonically welded to reduce drag.](../resources/Figure_06_02_05a.jpg "Body suits, such as this LZR Racer Suit, have been credited with many world records after their release in 2008.

Some interesting situations connected to Newton’s second law occur when
considering the effects of drag forces upon a moving object. For instance,
consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two
forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the
buoyant force). The downward force of gravity remains constant regardless of the
velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the person’s velocity
increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the
drag force is equal to the gravitational force, thus producing a net force of
zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as given by Newton’s
second law. At this point, the person’s velocity remains constant and we say
that the person has reached his *terminal velocity* ( $$ v_{t} $$ ). Since $$ F_
{\text{D}} $$ is proportional to the speed, a heavier skydiver must go faster
for $$ F_{\text{D}} $$ to equal his weight. Let’s see how this works out more
quantitatively.

At the terminal velocity,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-303">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=mg -F_{\text{D}}=ma =0 . $$ 
</div>

Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-38">
 $$ mg =F_{\text{D}}. $$ 
</div>

Using the equation for drag force, we have

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-19">
 $$ mg =\frac{1}{2}\rho C Av^{2}. $$ 
</div>

Solving for the velocity, we obtain

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-545">
 $$ v=\sqrt{\frac{2mg }{\rho CA}}. $$ 
</div>

Assume the density of air is $$ \rho =1.21 \text{kg/m}^{3} $$. A 75-kg skydiver
descending head first will have an area approximately $$ A=0.18\text{m}^{2} $$
and a drag coefficient of approximately $$ C=0.70 $$. We find that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-981">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v& =& \sqrt{\frac{2\left(75 \text{kg}\right)\left(9.80 \text{m/s}^{2}\right)}{\left(1.21 \text{kg}{\text{/m}}^{3}\right)\left(0.70\right)\left(0.18\text{m}^{2}\right)}}\\ & =& 98 \text{m/s}\\ & =& 350 \text{km/h}.
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

This means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a maximum terminal velocity
of about 350 km/h while traveling in a pike (head first) position, minimizing
the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may
decrease to about 200 km/h as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes
much smaller after the parachute opens.

Take-Home Experiment
</div>
This interesting activity examines the effect of weight upon terminal velocity. Gather together some nested coffee filters. Leaving them in their original shape, measure the time it takes for one, two, three, four, and five nested filters to fall to the floor from the same height (roughly 2 m). (Note that, due to the way the filters are nested, drag is constant and only mass varies.) They obtain terminal velocity quite quickly, so find this velocity as a function of mass. Plot the terminal velocity 
$$ v $$ 
 versus mass. Also plot  $$ v^{2} $$ versus mass. Which of these relationships is more linear? What can you
  conclude from these graphs?

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
A Terminal Velocity
</div>
Find the terminal velocity of an 85-kg skydiver falling in a spread-eagle position.

**Strategy**

At terminal velocity,$$ F_{\text{net}}=0 $$. Thus the drag force on the skydiver
must equal the force of gravity (the person’s weight). Using the equation of
drag force, we find $$ mg =\frac{1}{2}\rho C A v^{2} $$.

Thus the terminal velocity $$ v_{t} $$ can be written as

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-306">
 $$ v_{\text{t}}=\sqrt{\frac{2mg }{\rho C A}}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution**

All quantities are known except the person’s projected area. This is an adult
(85 kg) falling spread eagle. We can estimate the frontal area as

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-769">
 $$ A=\left(2 m\right)\left(0.35 \text{m}\right)=0.70\text{m}^{2}. $$ 
</div>
Using our equation for  $$ v_{\text{t}} $$, we find that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-656">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
v_{\text{t}}& =&
\sqrt{\frac{2\left(85\text{kg}\right)\left(9.80\text{m/s}^{2}\right)}{\left(1.21\text{kg/m}^{3}\right)
\left(1.0\right)\left(0.70\text{m}^{2}\right)}}\\ & 
=& 44 \text{m/s} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This result is consistent with the value for $$ v_{\text{t}} $$ mentioned
earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a $$ v=98 \text{m/s} $$. He
weighed less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the
air.

</div>

The size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting
application of air drag. If you fall from a 5-m high branch of a tree, you will
likely get hurt—possibly fracturing a bone. However, a small squirrel does this
all the time, without getting hurt. You don’t reach a terminal velocity in such
a short distance, but the squirrel does.

The following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a
1928 essay by a British biologist, J.B.S. Haldane, titled “On Being the Right
Size.”

*To the mouse and any smaller animal, \[gravity\] presents practically no
dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving
at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground
is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the
resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of
the moving object. Divide an animal’s length, breadth, and height each by ten;
its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So
the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten
times greater than the driving force.*

The above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the
object is very small, is going very slow, or is in a denser medium than air.
Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This
relationship is given by **Stokes’ law**{: data-type="term"
#import-auto-id1165298672873}, which states that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-798">
$$ F_{\text{s}}=6 \pi r\eta v, $$ 
</div>

where $$ r $$ is the radius of the object, $$ \eta $$ is the viscosity of the
fluid, and $$ v $$ is the object’s velocity.

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Stokes’ Law
</div>
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-271">
$$ F_{\text{s}}=6 \pi r\eta v, $$ 
</div>
where  $$ r $$ is the radius of the object, 
$$ \eta $$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and 
$$ v $$ is the object’s velocity.

</div>

Good examples of this law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust
particles. Because each of these objects is so small, we find that many of these
objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal
velocities for bacteria (size about $$ 1 \text{μm} $$) 
can be about $$ 2 \text{μm/s} $$. To move at a greater speed, many bacteria
swim using flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by
little motors embedded in the cell. Sediment in a lake can move at a greater
terminal velocity (about $$ 5 \text{μm/s} $$ ), so it can take days to reach the
bottom of the lake after being deposited on the surface.

If we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag
has influenced evolution. Fishes, dolphins, and even massive whales are
streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and migratory
species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long
necks. Flocks of birds fly in the shape of a spear head as the flock forms a
streamlined pattern (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298645387)). In humans,
one important example of streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be
efficient in their use of energy.

We now move from consideration of forces that affect the motion of an object (
such as friction and drag) to those that affect an object’s shape. If a
bulldozer pushes a car into a wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably
change shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a
**deformation**{: data-type="term"}. Even very small forces are known to cause
some deformation. For small deformations, two important characteristics are
observed. First, the object returns to its original shape when the force is
removed—that is, the deformation is elastic for small deformations. Second, the
size of the deformation is proportional to the force—that is, for small
deformations, Hooke’s law is obeyed. In equation form, **Hooke’s law**{:
data-type="term"} is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-940">
 $$ F=k\Delta L, $$
</div>

where $$ \Delta L $$ is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for
example) produced by the force $$ F $$, and $$ k $$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the shape and
composition of the object and the direction of the force. Note that this force
is a function of the deformation $$ \Delta L $$ —it is not constant as a kinetic
friction force is. Rearranging this to

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-72">
 $$ \Delta L=\frac{F}{k} $$
</div>

makes it clear that the deformation is proportional to the applied
force. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298678464) shows the Hooke’s law
relationship between the extension $$ \Delta L $$ of a spring or of a human
bone. For metals or springs, the straight line region in which Hooke’s law
pertains is much larger. Bones are brittle and the elastic region is small and
the fracture abrupt. Eventually a large enough stress to the material will cause
it to break or fracture. **Tensile strength**{: data-type="
term"} is the breaking stress that will cause permanent deformation or fracture
of a material.

{: #import-auto-id1165298678464}

The proportionality constant $$ k $$ depends upon a number of factors for the
material. For example, a guitar string made of nylon stretches when it is
tightened, and the elongation $$ \Delta L $$ is proportional to the force
applied (at least for small deformations). Thicker nylon strings and ones made
of steel stretch less for the same applied force, implying they have a larger $$
k $$
(see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296232089)). Finally, all three strings
return to their normal lengths when the force is removed, provided the
deformation is small. Most materials will behave in this manner if the
deformation is less than about 0.1% or about 1 part in $$ 10^{3} $$.

![Diagram of weight w attached to each of three guitar strings of initial length L zero hanging vertically from a ceiling. The weight pulls down on the strings with force w. The ceiling pulls up on the strings with force w. The first string of thin nylon has a deformation of delta L due to the force of the weight pulling down. The middle string of thicker nylon has a smaller deformation. The third string of thin steel has the smallest deformation.](../resources/Figure_06_03_02a.jpg "The same force, in this case a weight ( \( w \) ), applied to three different guitar strings of identical length produces the three different deformations shown as shaded segments.

Stretch Yourself a Little
</div>
How would you go about measuring the proportionality constant $$ k $$ of a rubber band? If a rubber band stretched 3 cm when a 100-g mass was attached
to it, then how much would it stretch if two similar rubber bands were attached
to the same mass—even if put together in parallel or alternatively if tied
together in series?

</div>

We now consider three specific types of deformations: changes in length (tension
and compression), sideways shear (
stress), and changes in volume. All deformations are assumed to be small unless
otherwise stated.

### Changes in Length—Tension and Compression: Elastic Modulus

A change in length $$ \Delta L $$ is produced when a force is applied to a wire
or rod parallel to its length $$ L_{0} $$, either stretching it (a tension) or
compressing it. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298469619).)

![Figure a is a cylindrical rod standing on its end with a height of L sub zero. Two vectors labeled F extend away from each end. A dotted outline indicates that the rod is stretched by a length of delta L. Figure b is a similar rod of identical height L sub zero, but two vectors labeled F exert a force toward the ends of the rod. A dotted line indicates that the rod is compressed by a length of delta L.](../resources/Figure_06_03_03a.jpg "(a) Tension. The rod is stretched a length \( \Delta L \)  when a force is applied parallel to its length. (b) Compression. The same rod is compressed by forces with the same magnitude in the opposite direction. For very small deformations and uniform materials, \( \Delta L \) is approximately the same for the same magnitude of tension or compression. For larger deformations, the cross-sectional area changes as the rod is compressed or stretched.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298469619}

Experiments have shown that the change in length ( $$ \Delta L $$)
depends on only a few variables. As already noted, $$ \Delta L $$ is
proportional to the force $$ F $$ and depends on the substance from which the
object is made. Additionally, the change in length is proportional to the
original length $$ L_{0} $$ and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional
area of the wire or rod. For example, a long guitar string will stretch more
than a short one, and a thick string will stretch less than a thin one. We can
combine all these factors into one equation for $$ \Delta L $$:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-511">
 $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ \Delta L $$ is the change in length, $$ F $$ the applied force, $$ Y
$$ is a factor, called the elastic modulus or Young’s modulus, that depends on
the substance, $$ A $$ is the cross-sectional area, and $$ L_{0} $$ is the
original length. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576) lists values of $$ Y$$
for several materials—those with a large $$ Y $$ are said to have a
large tensile stiffness because they deform less for a given tension or
compression.

Young’s moduli are not listed for liquids and gases
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576) because they cannot be stretched or
compressed in only one direction. Note that there is an assumption that the
object does not accelerate, so that there are actually two applied forces of
magnitude $$ F $$ acting in opposite directions. For example, the strings
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298469619) are being pulled down by a force of
magnitude $$ w $$ and held up by the ceiling, which also exerts a force of
magnitude $$ w $$.

The Stretch of a Long Cable
</div>
Suspension cables are used to carry gondolas at ski resorts. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298535463)) Consider a suspension cable that includes an unsupported span of 3020 m. Calculate the amount of stretch in the steel cable. Assume that the cable has a diameter of 5.6 cm and the maximum tension it can withstand is $$ 3.0\times 10^{6}\N $$.

![Ski gondolas travel along suspension cables. A vast forest and snowy mountain peaks can be seen in the background.](../resources/Figure_06_03_04a.jpg "Gondolas travel along suspension cables at the Gala Yuzawa ski resort in Japan. (credit: Rudy Herman, Flickr)")
{: #import-auto-id1165298535463}

**Strategy**

The force is equal to the maximum tension, or $$ F=3.0\times 10^{6}\N $$.
The cross-sectional area is $$ \pi r^{2}=2.46 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$. The
equation $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$ can be used to find the
change in length.

**Solution**

All quantities are known. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-657">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta L& =& \left(\frac{1}{210 \times 10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{3.0\times 10^{6}\N }{2.46\times 10^{-3} \mm}\right)\left(3020 \m \right)\\
& =& 18 \m .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is quite a stretch, but only about 0.6% of the unsupported length. Effects
of temperature upon length might be important in these environments.

</div>

Bones, on the whole, do not fracture due to tension or compression. Rather they
generally fracture due to sideways impact or bending, resulting in the bone
shearing or snapping. The behavior of bones under tension and compression is
important because it determines the load the bones can carry. Bones are
classified as weight-bearing structures such as columns in buildings and trees.
Weight-bearing structures have special features; columns in building have
steel-reinforcing rods while trees and bones are fibrous. The bones in different
parts of the body serve different structural functions and are prone to
different stresses. Thus the bone in the top of the femur is arranged in thin
sheets separated by marrow while in other places the bones can be cylindrical
and filled with marrow or just solid. Overweight people have a tendency toward
bone damage due to sustained compressions in bone joints and tendons.

Another biological example of Hooke’s law occurs in tendons. Functionally, the
tendon (the tissue connecting muscle to bone) must stretch easily at first when
a force is applied, but offer a much greater restoring force for a greater
strain. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296334455) shows a stress-strain
relationship for a human tendon. Some tendons have a high collagen content so
there is relatively little strain, or length change; others, like support
tendons (as in the leg) can change length up to 10%. Note that this
stress-strain curve is nonlinear, since the slope of the line changes in
different regions. In the first part of the stretch called the toe region, the
fibers in the tendon begin to align in the direction of the stress—this is
called *uncrimping*. In the linear region, the fibrils will be stretched, and in
the failure region individual fibers begin to break. A simple model of this
relationship can be illustrated by springs in parallel: different springs are
activated at different lengths of stretch. Examples of this are given in the
problems at end of this chapter. Ligaments (tissue connecting bone to bone)
behave in a similar way.

![The strain on mammalian tendon is shown by a graph, with strain along the x axis and tensile stress along the y axis. The stress strain curve obtained has three regions, namely, toe region at the bottom, linear region between, and failure region at the top.](../resources/Figure_06_03_05_xa.jpg "Typical stress-strain curve for mammalian tendon. Three regions are shown: (1) toe region (2) linear region, and (3) failure region.")
{: #import-auto-id1165296334455}

Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic, the
arteries and lungs need to be very stretchable. The elastic properties of the
arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in the arteries increases
and arterial walls stretch when the blood is pumped out of the heart. When the
aortic valve shuts, the pressure in the arteries drops and the arterial walls
relax to maintain the blood flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling
exactly this—the elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through
with each pump of the heart. If the arteries were rigid, you would not feel a
pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The lungs
expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely and elastically
when we breathe out. Our skins are particularly elastic, especially for the
young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg with no visible sag in their
skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces with age. Gradual physiological
aging through reduction in elasticity starts in the early 20s.

Calculating Deformation: How Much Does Your Leg Shorten When You Stand on It?
</div>
Calculate the change in length of the upper leg bone (the femur) when a 70.0 kg
man supports 62.0 kg of his mass on it, assuming the bone to be equivalent to a
uniform rod that is 40.0 cm long and 2.00 cm in radius.

**Strategy**

The force is equal to the weight supported, or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-843">
 $$ F=mg =\left(62.0 \kg \right)\left(9.80 \mss \right)=607.6 \N , $$
</div>
and the cross-sectional area is $$ \pi r^{2}=1.257 \times 10^{-3} \mm $$. The equation $$ \Delta L=\frac{1}{Y}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$
can be used to find the change in length.

**Solution**

All quantities except $$ \Delta L $$ are known. Note that the compression value
for Young’s modulus for bone must be used here. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-24">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta L& =& \left(\frac{1}{9\times 10^{9}\text{N/m}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{607.6 \N }{1.257\times 10^{-3} \mm}\right)\left(0.400 \m \right)\\
& =& 2\times 10^{-5}\m .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This small change in length seems reasonable, consistent with our experience
that bones are rigid. In fact, even the rather large forces encountered during
strenuous physical activity do not compress or bend bones by large amounts.
Although bone is rigid compared with fat or muscle, several of the substances
listed in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576) have larger values of Young’s
modulus $$ Y $$. In other words, they are more rigid.

</div>

The equation for change in length is traditionally rearranged and written in the
following form:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-725">
 $$ \frac{F}{A}=Y\frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}}. $$
</div>

The ratio of force to area, $$ \frac{F}{A} $$, is defined as **stress**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298867113} (
measured in $$ \text{N/m}^{2} $$ ), and the ratio of the change in length
to length, $$ \frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}} $$, is defined as
**strain**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165298883978}
(a unitless quantity). In other words,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-760">
 $$ \text{stress}=Y \times \text{strain}. $$
</div>

In this form, the equation is analogous to Hooke’s law, with stress analogous to
force and strain analogous to deformation. If we again rearrange this equation
to the form

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-77">
 $$ F= Y A \frac{ \Delta L}{ L_{0}}, $$
</div>

we see that it is the same as Hooke’s law with a proportionality constant

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-903">
 $$ k=\frac{ Y A}{ L_{0}}. $$
</div>

This general idea—that force and the deformation it causes are proportional for
small deformations—applies to changes in length, sideways bending, and changes
in volume.

### Sideways Stress: Shear Modulus

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296375245) illustrates what is meant by a sideways
stress or a *shearing force*. Here the deformation is called $$ \Delta x $$ and
it is perpendicular to $$ L_{0} $$, rather than parallel as with tension and
compression. Shear deformation behaves similarly to tension and compression and
can be described with similar equations. The expression for
**shear deformation**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1165296259204} is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-178">
 $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ S $$ is the shear modulus (
see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576)) and $$ F $$ is the force applied
perpendicular to $$ L_{0} $$ and parallel to the cross-sectional area $$ A $$.
Again, to keep the object from accelerating, there are actually two equal and
opposite forces $$ F $$ applied across opposite faces, as illustrated
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296375245). The equation is logical—for
example, it is easier to bend a long thin pencil (small $$ A $$ )
than a short thick one, and both are more easily bent than similar steel
rods (large $$ S $$ ).

![Bookcase sheared by a force applied at the bottom right toward the bottom left, and at the top left toward the top right.](../resources/Figure_06_03_06a.jpg "Shearing forces are applied perpendicular to the length \( L_0 \) and parallel to the area \( A \), producing a deformation  \( \Delta x \). Vertical forces are not shown, but it should be kept in mind that in addition to the two shearing forces, \( F \) , there must be supporting forces to keep the object from rotating. The distorting effects of these supporting forces are ignored in this treatment. The weight of the object also is not shown, since it is usually negligible compared with forces large enough to cause significant deformations.")
{: #import-auto-id1165296375245}

Examination of the shear moduli in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576)
reveals some telling patterns. For example, shear moduli are less than Young’s
moduli for most materials. Bone is a remarkable exception. Its shear modulus is
not only greater than its Young’s modulus, but it is as large as that of steel.
This is why bones are so rigid.

The spinal column (consisting of 26 vertebral segments separated by discs)
provides the main support for the head and upper part of the body. The spinal
column has normal curvature for stability, but this curvature can be increased,
leading to increased shearing forces on the lower vertebrae. Discs are better at
withstanding compressional forces than shear forces. Because the spine is not
vertical, the weight of the upper body exerts some of both. Pregnant women and
people that are overweight (with large abdomens) need to move their shoulders
back to maintain balance, thereby increasing the curvature in their spine and so
increasing the shear component of the stress. An increased angle due to more
curvature increases the shear forces along the plane. These higher shear forces
increase the risk of back injury through ruptured discs. The lumbosacral disc (
the wedge shaped disc below the last vertebrae) is particularly at risk because
of its location.

The shear moduli for concrete and brick are very small; they are too highly
variable to be listed. Concrete used in buildings can withstand compression, as
in pillars and arches, but is very poor against shear, as might be encountered
in heavily loaded floors or during earthquakes. Modern structures were made
possible by the use of steel and steel-reinforced concrete. Almost by
definition, liquids and gases have shear moduli near zero, because they flow in
response to shearing forces.

Calculating Force Required to Deform: That Nail Does Not Bend Much Under a Load
</div>
Find the mass of the picture hanging from a steel nail as shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298644588),
given that the nail bends only $$ 1.80\times 10^{-6} \m $$. (Assume the shear

See [link] for a calculation of the mass of the picture.")
{: #import-auto-id1165298644588}

**Strategy**

The force $$ F $$ on the nail (neglecting the nail’s own weight) is the weight
of the picture $$ w $$. If we can find $$ w $$, then the mass of the picture is
just $$ \frac{w}{g} $$. The equation $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$
can be solved for $$ F $$.

**Solution**

Solving the equation $$ \Delta x=\frac{1}{S}\frac{F}{A} L_{0} $$ for $$ F $$, we
see that all other quantities can be found:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-458">
 $$ F= \frac{S A}{L_{0}} \Delta x. $$

*S* is found in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576) and is
$$ S=80 \times 10^{9} \text{N/m}^{2} $$. The radius $$ r $$
is 0.750 mm (as seen in the figure), so the cross-sectional area is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-365">
 $$ A=\pi r^{2}=1.77 \times 10^{-6} \mm. $$
</div>
The value for $$ L_{0} $$ is also shown in the figure. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-736">
 $$ F=\frac{ \left(80 \times 10^{9} \text{N/m}^{2}\right)\left(1.77 \times 10^{-6} \mm\right)}{\left(5.00 \times 10^{-3}\m \right)}\left(1.80 \times 10^{-6}\m \right)=51 \N . $$
</div>
This 51 N force is the weight $$ w $$ of the picture, so the picture’s mass is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-147">
 $$ m=\frac{w}{g}=\frac{F}{g}=5.2 \kg . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

This is a fairly massive picture, and it is impressive that the nail flexes only
$$ 1.80\times 10^{-6} \m $$ —an amount undetectable to the unaided eye.

### Changes in Volume: Bulk Modulus

An object will be compressed in all directions if inward forces are applied
evenly on all its surfaces as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165296230954). It is
relatively easy to compress gases and extremely difficult to compress liquids
and solids. For example, air in a wine bottle is compressed when it is corked.
But if you try corking a brim-full bottle, you cannot compress the wine—some
must be removed if the cork is to be inserted. The reason for these different
compressibilities is that atoms and molecules are separated by large empty
spaces in gases but packed close together in liquids and solids. To compress a
gas, you must force its atoms and molecules closer together. To compress liquids
and solids, you must actually compress their atoms and molecules, and very
strong electromagnetic forces in them oppose this compression.

![A cube with area of cross section A and volume V zero is compressed by an inward force F acting on all surfaces. The compression causes a change in volume delta V, which is proportional to the force per unit area and its original volume. This change in volume is related to the compressibility of the substance.](../resources/Figure_06_03_09a.jpg "An inward force on all surfaces compresses this cube. Its change in volume is proportional to the force per unit area and its original volume, and is related to the compressibility of the substance.")
{: #import-auto-id1165296230954}

We can describe the compression or volume deformation of an object with an
equation. First, we note that a force “applied evenly” is defined to have the
same stress, or ratio of force to area $$ \frac{F}{A} $$ on all surfaces. The
deformation produced is a change in volume $$ \Delta V $$, which is found to
behave very similarly to the shear, tension, and compression previously
discussed. (This is not surprising, since a compression of the entire object is
equivalent to compressing each of its three dimensions.) The relationship of the
change in volume to other physical quantities is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-63">
 $$ \Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A} V_{0}, $$
</div>

where $$ B $$ is the bulk modulus (see [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576)),
$$ V_{0} $$ is the original volume, and $$ \frac{F}{A} $$ is the force per
unit area applied uniformly inward on all surfaces. Note that
  no bulk moduli are given for gases.

What are some examples of bulk compression of solids and liquids? One practical
example is the manufacture of industrial-grade diamonds by compressing carbon
with an extremely large force per unit area. The carbon atoms rearrange their
crystalline structure into the more tightly packed pattern of diamonds. In
nature, a similar process occurs deep underground, where extremely large forces
result from the weight of overlying material. Another natural source of large
compressive forces is the pressure created by the weight of water, especially in
deep parts of the oceans. Water exerts an inward force on all surfaces of a
submerged object, and even on the water itself. At great depths, water is
measurably compressed, as the following example illustrates.

Calculating Change in Volume with Deformation: How Much Is Water Compressed at Great Ocean Depths?
</div>
Calculate the fractional decrease in volume ( $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}} $$ )
for seawater at 5.00 km depth, where the force per unit area is $$ 5.00 \times
10^{7} \N/ \mm $$.

**Strategy**

Equation $$ \Delta V=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A} V_{0} $$ is the correct physical
relationship. All quantities in the equation except $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}}
$$ are known.

**Solution**

Solving for the unknown $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}} $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-646">
 $$ \frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}}=\frac{1}{B}\frac{F}{A}. $$
</div>
Substituting known values with the value for the bulk modulus
$$ B $$ from [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1165298671576),

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-818">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\frac{ \Delta V}{ V_{0}}
& =& \frac{5.00\times 10^{7} \N/\mm }
{2.2\times 10^{9} \N/\mm} \\
& =& 0.023=2.3%.
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

Although measurable, this is not a significant decrease in volume considering
that the force per unit area is about 500 atmospheres (1 million pounds per
square foot). Liquids and solids are extraordinarily difficult to compress.

</div>

Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to
expand but are constrained from doing so—which is equivalent to compressing them
to less than their normal volume. This often occurs when a contained material
warms up, since most materials expand when their temperature increases. If the
materials are tightly constrained, they deform or break their container. Another
very common example occurs when water freezes. Water, unlike most materials,
expands when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a
biological cell, or crack an engine block that gets in its way.

Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave analogously to
the tension, shear, and bulk deformations considered here.

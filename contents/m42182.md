Why does Earth keep on spinning? What started it spinning to begin with? And how
does an ice skater manage to spin faster and faster simply by pulling her arms
in? Why does she not have to exert a torque to spin faster? Questions like these
have answers based in angular momentum, the rotational analog to linear
momentum.

By now the pattern is clear—every rotational phenomenon has a direct
translational analog. It seems quite reasonable, then, to define **angular
momentum**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id3209780} $$ L $$ as

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-337">
 $$ L=I \omega. $$ 
</div>

This equation is an analog to the definition of linear momentum as $$ p=mv $$.
Units for linear momentum are $$ \text{kg}\cdot \text{m/s} $$ while units for
angular momentum are $$ \text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\text{/s} $$. As we would
expect, an object that has a large moment of inertia $$ I $$, such as Earth, has
a very large angular momentum. An object that has a large angular velocity $$
\omega $$, such as a centrifuge, also has a rather large angular momentum.

Making Connections
</div>
Angular momentum is completely analogous to linear momentum, first presented in [Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation](/contents/m42140). It has the same implications in terms of carrying rotation forward, and it is conserved when the net external torque is zero. Angular momentum, like linear momentum, is also a property of the atoms and subatomic particles.

Calculating Angular Momentum of the Earth
</div>

**Strategy**

No information is given in the statement of the problem; so we must look up
pertinent data before we can calculate $$ L=I \omega $$. First, according
to [\[link\]](/contents/m42179#fs-id1838666), the formula for the moment of
inertia of a sphere is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-654">
 $$ I=\frac{2 MR^{2}}{5} $$ 
</div>
so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-239">
 $$ L=I\omega\frac{2 MR^{2}\omega }{5}. $$ 
</div>
Earth’s mass  $$ M $$ 

is $$ 5.979 \times 10^{24}\text{kg} $$ and its radius $$ R $$ is $$ 6.376 \times
10^{6}\text{m} $$. The Earth’s angular velocity $$ \omega $$ is, of course,
exactly one revolution per day, but we must covert $$ \omega $$ to radians per
second to do the calculation in SI units.

**Solution**

Substituting known information into the expression for $$ L $$ and converting $$
\omega $$ to radians per second gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-297">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}L& =& 0.4\left(5.979 \times 10^{24}\text{kg}\right){\left(6.376 \times 10^{6}\text{m}\right)}^{2}\left(\frac{1\text{rev}}{\text{d}}\right)\\ & =& 9.72 \times 10^{37}\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\cdot \text{rev/d}.
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
Substituting  $$ 2\pi  $$ 

rad for $$ 1 $$ rev and $$ 8.64 \times 10^{4}\text{s} $$ for 1 day gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-195">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}L& =& \left(9.72 \times 10^{37}\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi \text{rad/rev}}{8.64 \times 10^{4}\text{s/d}}\right)\left(1\text{rev/d}\right)\\ & =& 7.07 \times 10^{33}\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\text{/s}.
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

This number is large, demonstrating that Earth, as expected, has a tremendous
angular momentum. The answer is approximate, because we have assumed a constant
density for Earth in order to estimate its moment of inertia.

</div>

When you push a merry-go-round, spin a bike wheel, or open a door, you exert a
torque. If the torque you exert is greater than opposing torques, then the
rotation accelerates, and angular momentum increases. The greater the net
torque, the more rapid the increase in $$ L $$. The relationship between torque
and angular momentum is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-628">
 $$ \text{net}\tau =\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}. $$ 
</div>

This expression is exactly analogous to the relationship between force and
linear momentum, $$ F=\Delta p/\Delta t $$. The equation $$ \text{net}\tau
=\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} $$ is very fundamental and broadly applicable. It is,
in fact, the rotational form of Newton’s second law.

Calculating the Torque Putting Angular Momentum Into a Lazy Susan
</div>
[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1438810) shows a Lazy Susan food tray being rotated by a person in quest of sustenance. Suppose the person exerts a 2.50 N force perpendicular to the lazy Susan’s 0.260-m radius for 0.150 s. (a) What is the final angular momentum of the lazy Susan if it starts from rest, assuming friction is negligible? (b) What is the final angular velocity of the lazy Susan, given that its mass is 4.00 kg and assuming its moment of inertia is that of a disk?

![The given figure shows a lazy Susan on which various eatables like cake, salad grapes, and a drink are kept. A hand is shown that applies a force F, indicated by a leftward pointing horizontal arrow. This force is perpendicular to the radius r and thus tangential to the circular lazy Susan.](../resources/Figure_11_05_01a.jpg "A partygoer exerts a torque on a lazy Susan to make it rotate. The equation net &#x3C4;=&#x394;L&#x394;t size 12{&quot;net &quot;&#x3C4;= { {&#x394;L} over {&#x394;t} } } {} gives the relationship between torque and the angular momentum produced.")
{: #import-auto-id1438810}

**Strategy**

We can find the angular momentum by solving $$ \text{net}\tau =\frac{\Delta
L}{\Delta t} $$ for $$ \Delta L $$, and using the given information to calculate
the torque. The final angular momentum equals the change in angular momentum,
because the lazy Susan starts from rest. That is, $$ \Delta L=L $$. To find the
final velocity, we must calculate $$ \omega $$ from the definition of $$ L $$ in
$$ L=I \omega $$.

**Solution for (a)**

Solving $$ \text{net}\tau =\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} $$ for $$ \Delta L $$ gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-994">
 $$ \Delta L=\left(\text{net}\text{τ}\right)\Delta t. $$ 
</div>
Because the force is perpendicular to  $$ r $$ 

, we see that $$ \text{net}\tau =rF $$, so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-911">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}L& =& rF\Delta t=\left(0.260 \text{m}\right)\left(2.50 N\right)\left(0.150 s\right)\\ & =& 9.75 \times 10^{-2}\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}/\text{s}.
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

The final angular velocity can be calculated from the definition of angular
momentum,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-982">
 $$ L=I \omega. $$ 
</div>
Solving for  $$ \omega  $$ 

and substituting the formula for the moment of inertia of a disk into the
resulting equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-963">
 $$ \omega =\frac{L}{I}=\frac{L}{\frac{1}{2}M R^{2}}. $$ 
</div>
And substituting known values into the preceding equation yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-98">
 $$ \omega =\frac{9.75 \times 10^{-2}\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\text{/s}}{\left(0.500\right)\left(4.00\text{kg}\right)\left(0.260\text{m}\right)}=0.721\text{rad/s}. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

Note that the imparted angular momentum does not depend on any property of the
object but only on torque and time. The final angular velocity is equivalent to
one revolution in 8.71 s (determination of the time period is left as an
exercise for the reader), which is about right for a lazy Susan.

Calculating the Torque in a Kick
</div>
The person whose leg is shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1817652) kicks his leg by exerting a 2000-N force with his upper leg muscle. The effective perpendicular lever arm is 2.20 cm. Given the moment of inertia of the lower leg is  $$ 1.25 kg\cdot \text{m}^{2} $$ 

, (a) find the angular acceleration of the leg. (b) Neglecting the gravitational
force, what is the rotational kinetic energy of the leg after it has rotated
through $$ 57.3^\circ $$
(1.00 rad)?

![The figure shows a human leg, from the thighs to the feet which is bent at the knee joint. The radius of curvature of the knee is indicated as r equal to two point two zero centimeters and the moment of inertia of the lower half of the leg is indicated as I equal to one point two five kilogram meter square. The direction of torque is indicated by a red arrow in anti-clockwise direction, near the knee.](../resources/Figure_11_05_02a.jpg "The muscle in the upper leg gives the lower leg an angular acceleration and imparts rotational kinetic energy to it by exerting a torque about the knee. F is a vector that is perpendicular to r. This example examines the situation.")
{: #import-auto-id1817652}

**Strategy**

The angular acceleration can be found using the rotational analog to Newton’s
second law, or $$ \alpha =\text{net}\tau /I $$. The moment of inertia $$ I $$ is
given and the torque can be found easily from the given force and perpendicular
lever arm. Once the angular acceleration $$ \alpha $$ is known, the final
angular velocity and rotational kinetic energy can be calculated.

**Solution to (a)**

From the rotational analog to Newton’s second law, the angular acceleration $$
\alpha $$ is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-761">
 $$ \alpha =\frac{\text{net}\tau }{I}. $$ 
</div>
Because the force and the perpendicular lever arm are given and the leg is vertical so that its weight does not create a torque, the net torque is thus

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-466">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\text{net}\tau & =& r_{\perp }F\\ & =& \left(0.0220 \text{m}\right)\left(2000\text{N}\right)\\ & =& 44.0 \text{N}\cdot \text{m} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
Substituting this value for the torque and the given value for the moment of inertia into the expression for  $$ \alpha  $$ 

gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-388">
 $$ \alpha =\frac{44.0\text{N}\cdot \text{m}}{1.25\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}}=35.2 \text{rad/s}^{2}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution to (b)**

The final angular velocity can be calculated from the kinematic expression

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-632">
 $$ {\omega }^{2}={ {\omega }_{0}}^{2}+2 \alpha \theta $$ 
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-493">
 $$ {\omega }^{2}=2 \alpha \theta $$ 
</div>
because the initial angular velocity is zero. The kinetic energy of rotation is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-182">
 $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2} $$ 
</div>
so it is most convenient to use the value of  $$ {\omega }^{2} $$ 

just found and the given value for the moment of inertia. The kinetic energy is
then

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-877">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}& =& 0.5\left(1.25\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\right)\left(70.4{\text{rad}}^{2}/{\text{s}}^{2}\right)\\ & =& 44.0\text{J}
\end{array}. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

These values are reasonable for a person kicking his leg starting from the
position shown. The weight of the leg can be neglected in part (a) because it
exerts no torque when the center of gravity of the lower leg is directly beneath
the pivot in the knee. In part (b), the force exerted by the upper leg is so
large that its torque is much greater than that created by the weight of the
lower leg as it rotates. The rotational kinetic energy given to the lower leg is
enough that it could give a ball a significant velocity by transferring some of
this energy in a kick.

Making Connections: Conservation Laws
</div>
Angular momentum, like energy and linear momentum, is conserved. This universally applicable law is another sign of underlying unity in physical laws. Angular momentum is conserved when net external torque is zero, just as linear momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero.

</div>

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

We can now understand why Earth keeps on spinning. As we saw in the previous
example, $$ \Delta L=\left(
\text{net}\tau \right)\Delta t $$. This equation means that, to change angular
momentum, a torque must act over some period of time. Because Earth has a large
angular momentum, a large torque acting over a long time is needed to change its
rate of spin. So what external torques are there? Tidal friction exerts torque
that is slowing Earth’s rotation, but tens of millions of years must pass before
the change is very significant. Recent research indicates the length of the day
was 18 h some 900 million years ago. Only the tides exert significant retarding
torques on Earth, and so it will continue to spin, although ever more slowly,
for many billions of years.

What we have here is, in fact, another conservation law. If the net torque is 
*zero*, then angular momentum is constant or *conserved*. We can see this
rigorously by considering $$ \text{net}\tau =\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t} $$ for
the situation in which the net torque is zero. In that case,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-283">
 $$ \text{net}\tau =0 $$ 
</div>

implying that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-576">
 $$ \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}=0. $$ 
</div>

If the change in angular momentum $$ \Delta L $$ is zero, then the angular
momentum is constant; thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-10">
 $$ L=\text{constant}; \left(\text{net}\tau =0\right) $$ 
</div>

or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-67">
 $$ L=L^{\prime} ; \left(\text{ net }\tau =0\right). $$ 
</div>

These expressions are the **law of conservation of angular momentum**{:
data-type="term" #import-auto-id1412261} . Conservation laws are as scarce as
they are important.

An example of conservation of angular momentum is seen
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2452786), in which an ice skater is executing a
spin. The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively
little friction between her skates and the ice and because the friction is
exerted very close to the pivot point. (Both $$ F $$ and $$ r $$ are small, and
so $$ \tau $$ is negligibly small.) Consequently, she can spin for quite some
time. She can do something else, too. She can increase her rate of spin by
pulling her arms and legs in. Why does pulling her arms and legs in increase her
rate of spin? The answer is that her angular momentum is constant, so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-572">
 $$ L=L^{\prime} . $$ 
</div>

Expressing this equation in terms of the moment of inertia,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-752">
 $$ I\omegaI^{\prime} \omega \prime , $$ 
</div>

where the primed quantities refer to conditions after she has pulled in her arms
and reduced her moment of inertia. Because $$ I^{\prime} $$ is smaller, the
angular velocity $$ \omega \prime $$ must increase to keep the angular momentum
constant. The change can be dramatic, as the following example shows.

![The image a shows an ice skater spinning on the tip of her skate with both her arms and one leg extended. The image b shows the ice skater spinning on the tip of one skate, with her arms crossed and one leg supported on another.](../resources/Figure_11_05_03a.jpg "(a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. Her angular momentum is conserved because the net torque on her is negligibly small. In the next image, her rate of spin increases greatly when she pulls in her arms, decreasing her moment of inertia. The work she does to pull in her arms results in an increase in rotational kinetic energy.")

Calculating the Angular Momentum of a Spinning Skater
</div>
Suppose an ice skater, such as the one in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2452786), is spinning at 0.800 rev/ s with her arms extended. She has a moment of inertia of  $$ 2.34\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2} $$ 

with her arms extended and of $$ 0.363\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2} $$ with her
arms close to her body. (These moments of inertia are based on reasonable
assumptions about a 60.0-kg skater.) (a) What is her angular velocity in
revolutions per second after she pulls in her arms? (b) What is her rotational
kinetic energy before and after she does this?

**Strategy**

In the first part of the problem, we are looking for the skater’s angular
velocity $$ \omega \prime $$ after she has pulled in her arms. To find this
quantity, we use the conservation of angular momentum and note that the moments
of inertia and initial angular velocity are given. To find the initial and final
kinetic energies, we use the definition of rotational kinetic energy given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-489">
 $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (a)**

Because torque is negligible (as discussed above), the conservation of angular
momentum given in $$ I\omegaI^{\prime} \omega \prime $$ is applicable. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-310">
 $$ L=L^{\prime}  $$ 
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-100">
 $$ I\omegaI^{\prime} \omega \prime  $$ 
</div>
Solving for  $$ \omega \prime  $$ 

and substituting known values into the resulting equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-158">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\omega \prime & =& \frac{I}{I^{\prime}}\omega 
=\left(\frac{2.34 \text{kg}\cdot {m}^{2}}{0.363 \text{kg}\cdot {m}^{2}}\right)
\left(0.800 \text{rev/s}\right)\\ & =& 5.16 \text{rev/s.}
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

Rotational kinetic energy is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-377">
 $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}. $$ 
</div>
The initial value is found by substituting known values into the equation and converting the angular velocity to rad/s:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-8">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}{\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}& =& \left(0.5\right)\left(2.34\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\right){\left(\left(0.800\text{rev/s}\right)\left(2\pi \text{rad/rev}\right)\right)}^{2}\\ & =& 29.6\text{J} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
The final rotational kinetic energy is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-30">
 $$ {\text{KE}}_{\text{rot}}\prime =\frac{1}{2}I^{\prime} {\omega \prime }^{2}. $$ 
</div>
Substituting known values into this equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-307">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}K{E}_{\text{rot}}\prime & =& \left(0.5\right)\left(0.363 \text{kg}\cdot {m}^{2}\right){\left[\left(5.16 \text{rev/s}\right)\left(2\pi  rad/rev\right)\right]}^{2}\\ & =& 191 \text{J} .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

In both parts, there is an impressive increase. First, the final angular
velocity is large, although most world-class skaters can achieve spin rates
about this great. Second, the final kinetic energy is much greater than the
initial kinetic energy. The increase in rotational kinetic energy comes from
work done by the skater in pulling in her arms. This work is internal work that
depletes some of the skater’s food energy.

</div>

There are several other examples of objects that increase their rate of spin
because something reduced their moment of inertia. Tornadoes are one example.
Storm systems that create tornadoes are slowly rotating. When the radius of
rotation narrows, even in a local region, angular velocity increases, sometimes
to the furious level of a tornado. Earth is another example. Our planet was born
from a huge cloud of gas and dust, the rotation of which came from turbulence in
an even larger cloud. Gravitational forces caused the cloud to contract, and the
rotation rate increased as a result. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1907322).)

![The first figure shows a cloud of dust and gas,which is in the shape of a distorted circle, rotating in anti-clockwise direction with an angular velocity omega, indicated by a curved black arrow, and having an angular momentum L. The second figure shows an elliptical cloud of dust with the Sun in the middle of it, rotating in anti-clockwise direction with an angular velocity omega dash, indicated by a curved black arrow, and having an angular momentum L. The third figure depicts the Solar System, with the Sun in the middle of it and the various planets revolve around it in their respective elliptical orbits in anti-clockwise direction, which is indicated by arrows. The angular momentum remains L.](../resources/Figure_11_05_04a.jpg "The Solar System coalesced from a cloud of gas and dust that was originally rotating. The orbital motions and spins of the planets are in the same direction as the original spin and conserve the angular momentum of the parent cloud.")
{: #import-auto-id1907322}

In case of human motion, one would not expect angular momentum to be conserved
when a body interacts with the environment as its foot pushes off the ground.
Astronauts floating in space aboard the International Space Station have no
angular momentum relative to the inside of the ship if they are motionless.
Their bodies will continue to have this zero value no matter how they twist
about as long as they do not give themselves a push off the side of the vessel.

Construct Your Own Problem
</div>
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Consider the Earth-Moon system. Construct a problem in which you calculate the total angular momentum of the system including the spins of the Earth and the Moon on their axes and the orbital angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system in its nearly monthly rotation. Calculate what happens to the Moon’s orbital radius if the Earth’s rotation decreases due to tidal drag. Among the things to be considered are the amount by which the Earth’s rotation slows and the fact that the Moon will continue to have one side always facing the Earth.

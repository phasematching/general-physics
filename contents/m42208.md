### Torricelli’s Theorem

[\[link\]](#import-auto-id1602915) shows water gushing from a large tube through a dam. What is its speed as it emerges? Interestingly, if resistance is negligible, the speed is just what it would be if the water fell a distance  $$h $$
 from the surface of the reservoir; the water’s speed is independent of the size of the opening. Let us check this out. Bernoulli’s equation must be used since the depth is not constant. We consider water flowing from the surface (point 1) to the tube’s outlet (point 2). Bernoulli’s equation as stated in previously is

<div class="equation" id="import-auto-id2679980">
 $${P}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho gh_{1}={P}_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho gh_{2}\text{.} $$
</div>

Both  $${P}_{1} $$
 and  $${P}_{2} $$
 equal atmospheric pressure <sup />( $${P}_{1} $$
 is atmospheric pressure because it is the pressure at the top of the reservoir.  $${P}_{2} $$
 must be atmospheric pressure, since the emerging water is surrounded by the atmosphere and cannot have a pressure different from atmospheric pressure.) and subtract out of the equation, leaving

<div class="equation" id="import-auto-id2653363">
 $$\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho gh_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho gh_{2}\text{.} $$
</div>

Solving this equation for  $${v}_{2}^{2} $$
, noting that the density  $$\rho  $$
 cancels (because the fluid is incompressible), yields

<div class="equation" id="import-auto-id2654856">
 $${v}_{2}^{2}={v}_{1}^{2}+2g\left({h}_{1}-{h}_{2}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>

We let  $$h={h}_{1}-{h}_{2} $$
; the equation then becomes

<div class="equation" id="import-auto-id3356178">
 $${v}_{2}^{2}={v}_{1}^{2}+2gh $$
</div>

where  $$h $$
 is the height dropped by the water. This is simply a kinematic equation for any object falling a distance  $$h $$
 with negligible resistance. In fluids, this last equation is called *Torricelli’s theorem*. Note that the result is independent of the velocity’s direction, just as we found when applying conservation of energy to falling objects.

 ![Part a of the figure shows a photograph of a dam with water gushing from a large tube at the base of a dam. Part b shows the schematic diagram for the flow of water in a reservoir. The reservoir is shown in the form of a triangular section with a horizontal opening along the base little near to the base. The water is shown to flow through the horizontal opening near the base. The height which it falls is shown as h two. The pressure and velocity of water at this point are P two and v two. The height to which the water can fall if it falls from a height h above the opening is given by h 2. The pressure and velocity of water at this point are P one and v one.](../resources/Figure_13_03_01a.jpg "(a) Water gushes from the base of the Studen Kladenetz dam in Bulgaria.

![Figure shows a fire engine that is stationed next to a tall building. A floor of the building ten meters above the ground has caught fire. The flames are shown coming out. A fire man has reached close to the fire caught area using a ladder and is spraying water on the fire using a hose attached to the fire engine.](../resources/Figure_13_03_02a.jpg "Pressure in the nozzle of this fire hose is less than at ground level for two reasons: the water has to go uphill to get to the nozzle, and speed increases in the nozzle. In spite of its lowered pressure, the water can exert a large force on anything it strikes, by virtue of its kinetic energy. Pressure in the water stream becomes equal to atmospheric pressure once it emerges into the air."){: #import-auto-id3306423}

All preceding applications of Bernoulli’s equation involved simplifying conditions, such as constant height or constant pressure. The next example is a more general application of Bernoulli’s equation in which pressure, velocity, and height all change. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id3306423).)

<div class="title">
Calculating Pressure: A Fire Hose Nozzle
</div>
Fire hoses used in major structure fires have inside diameters of 6.40 cm. Suppose such a hose carries a flow of 40.0 L/s starting at a gauge pressure of  $$ 1.62 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$
. The hose goes 10.0 m up a ladder to a nozzle having an inside diameter of 3.00 cm. Assuming negligible resistance, what is the pressure in the nozzle?

**Strategy**

Here we must use Bernoulli’s equation to solve for the pressure, since depth is not constant.

**Solution**

Bernoulli’s equation states

<div class="equation">
 $${P}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho gh_{1}={P}_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho gh_{2}\text{,} $$
</div>
where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the initial conditions at ground level and the final conditions inside the nozzle, respectively. We must first find the speeds  $${v}_{1} $$
 and  $${v}_{2} $$
. Since  $$Q={A}_{1}{v}_{1} $$ , we get

<div class="equation">
 $${v}_{1}=\frac{Q}{ {A}_{1}}=\frac{ 40.0 \times 10^{-3}  {\text{m}}^{3}\text{/s}}{\pi {\left( 3.20 \times 10^{-2}  \text{m} \right)}^{2}}= 12.4 \text{m/s}\text{.} $$
</div>
Similarly, we find

<div class="equation">
 $${v}_{2}=56.6 \text{m/s}\text{.} $$
</div>
(This rather large speed is helpful in reaching the fire.) Now, taking  $${h}_{1} $$
 to be zero, we solve Bernoulli’s equation for  $${P}_{2} $$
\:

<div class="equation">
 $${P}_{2}={P}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho \left({v}_{1}^{2}-{v}_{2}^{2}\right)-\rho gh_{2}\text{.} $$
</div>
Substituting known values yields

<div class="equation">
 $${P}_{2}= 1.62 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(1000 {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left[  { \left( 12.4 \text{m/s} \right)}^{2}-{\left(  56.6 \text{m/s} \right)}^{2}\right]  -\left(1000 {\text{kg/m}}^{3}\right)\left( 9.80 {\text{m/s}}^{2}\right)\left( 10.0 \text{m}\right)=0\text{.} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This value is a gauge pressure, since the initial pressure was given as a gauge pressure. Thus the nozzle pressure equals atmospheric pressure, as it must because the water exits into the atmosphere without changes in its conditions.

</div>

### Power in Fluid Flow

Power is the *rate* at which work is done or energy in any form is used or supplied. To see the relationship of power to fluid flow, consider Bernoulli’s equation:

<div class="equation">
 $$P+\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}+\rho gh=\text{constant}\text{.} $$
</div>

All three terms have units of energy per unit volume, as discussed in the previous section. Now, considering units, if we multiply energy per unit volume by flow rate (volume per unit time), we get units of power. That is,  $$\left(E/V\right)\left(V/t\right)=E/t $$
. This means that if we multiply Bernoulli’s equation by flow rate * $$Q $$
*, we get power. In equation form, this is

<div class="equation">
 $$\left(P+\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}+\rho gh\right)Q=\text{power}\text{.} $$
</div>

Each term has a clear physical meaning. For example, * $$\text{PQ} $$
* is the power supplied to a fluid, perhaps by a pump, to give it its pressure * $$P $$
*. Similarly,  $$\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}Q $$
 is the power supplied to a fluid to give it its kinetic energy. And  $$\rho \text{ghQ} $$
 is the power going to gravitational potential energy.

<div class="title">
Making Connections: Power
</div>
Power is defined as the rate of energy transferred, or * $$E/t $$
*. Fluid flow involves several types of power. Each type of power is identified with a specific type of energy being expended or changed in form.

<div class="title">
Calculating Power in a Moving Fluid
</div>
Suppose the fire hose in the previous example is fed by a pump that receives water through a hose with a 6.40-cm diameter coming from a hydrant with a pressure of  $$ 0.700 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$
. What power does the pump supply to the water?

**Strategy**

Here we must consider energy forms as well as how they relate to fluid flow. Since the input and output hoses have the same diameters and are at the same height, the pump does not change the speed of the water nor its height, and so the water’s kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy are unchanged. That means the pump only supplies power to increase water pressure by  $$ 0.92 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$
 (from  $$ 0.700 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$
 to  $$ 1.62 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2} $$
).

**Solution**

As discussed above, the power associated with pressure is

<div class="equation">
 $$\begin{array}{lll}\text{power}& =& \text{PQ}\\ & =& \left( 0.920 \times 10^{6}  {\text{N/m}}^{2}\right)\left( 40.0 \times 10^{-3}  {\text{m}}^{3}\text{/s}\right)\text{.}\\  & =&  3.68 \times 10^{4}  \text{W}= 36.8 \text{kW}\end{array} $$
</div>
**Discussion**

Such a substantial amount of power requires a large pump, such as is found on some fire trucks. (This kilowatt value converts to about 50 hp.) The pump in this example increases only the water’s pressure. If a pump—such as the heart—directly increases velocity and height as well as pressure, we would have to calculate all three terms to find the power it supplies.

</div>

### Summary

* {: #import-auto-id2384811} Power in fluid flow is given by the equation
   $$\left({P}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}+\rho gh\right)Q=\text{power}\text{,} $$ where the first term is power associated with pressure, the second is power associated with velocity, and the third is power associated with height.

A frequently quoted rule of thumb in aircraft design is that wings should produce about 1000 N of lift per square meter of wing. (The fact that a wing has a top and bottom surface does not double its area.) (a) At takeoff, an aircraft travels at 60.0 m/s, so that the air speed relative to the bottom of the wing is 60.0 m/s. Given the sea level density of air to be  $$ 1.29 {\text{kg/m}}^{3} $$
, how fast must it move over the upper surface to create the ideal lift? (b) How fast must air move over the upper surface at a cruising speed of 245 m/s and at an altitude where air density is one-fourth that at sea level? (Note that this is not all of the aircraft’s lift—some comes from the body of the plane, some from engine thrust, and so on. Furthermore, Bernoulli’s principle gives an approximate answer because flow over the wing creates turbulence.)

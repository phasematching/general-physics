The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold.
Human perception of what feels hot or cold is a relative one. For example, if
you place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, and then place both
hands in tepid water, the tepid water will feel cool to the hand that was in hot
water, and warm to the one that was in cold water. The scientific definition of
temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot and cold. **Temperature**
is operationally defined to be what we measure with a thermometer. (Many
physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured. We
shall see later how temperature is related to the kinetic energies of atoms and
molecules, a more physical explanation.) Two accurate thermometers, one placed
in hot water and the other in cold water, will show the hot water to have a
higher temperature. If they are then placed in the tepid water, both will give
identical readings (within measurement uncertainties). In this section, we
discuss temperature, its measurement by thermometers, and its relationship to
thermal equilibrium. Again, temperature is the quantity measured by a
thermometer.

Misconception Alert: Human Perception vs. Reality
</div>
On a cold winter morning, the wood on a porch feels warmer than the metal of your bike. The wood and bicycle are in thermal equilibrium with the outside air, and are thus the same temperature. They **feel** different because of the difference in the way that they conduct heat away from your skin. The metal conducts heat away from your body faster than the wood does (see more about conductivity in [Conduction](../contents/ch14Conduction)). This is just one example demonstrating that the human sense of hot and cold is not determined by temperature alone.

Another factor that affects our perception of temperature is humidity. Most
people feel much hotter on hot, humid days than on hot, dry days. This is
because on humid days, sweat does not evaporate from the skin as efficiently as
it does on dry days. It is the evaporation of sweat (or water from a sprinkler
or pool) that cools us off.

</div>

Any physical property that depends on temperature, and whose response to
temperature is reproducible, can be used as the basis of a thermometer. Because
many physical properties depend on temperature, the variety of thermometers is
remarkable. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances.
This property is the basis for the common alcohol thermometer, the old mercury
thermometer, and the bimetallic strip ([[Figure 1]](#Figure1)). Other properties
used to measure temperature include electrical resistance and color, as shown
in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2), and the emission of infrared radiation, as shown
in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

![This figure has two parts, each of which shows a blue metallic strip attached lengthwise to a yellow metallic strip, thus forming a bimetallic strip. In part a, the bimetallic strip is straight and oriented vertically, and its temperature is given as T sub 0. In part b, the bimetallic strip is curving rightward away from the vertical, and its temperature is given as T, which is greater than T sub 0.](../resources/Figure_13_01_01.jpg "The curvature of a bimetallic strip depends on temperature. (a) The strip is straight at the starting temperature, where its two components have the same length. (b) At a higher temperature, this strip bends to the right, because the metal on the left has expanded more than the metal on the right.")

### Temperature Scales

Thermometers are used to measure temperature according to well-defined scales of
measurement, which use pre-defined reference points to help compare quantities.
The three most common temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin
scales. A temperature scale can be created by identifying two easily
reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at
standard atmospheric pressure are commonly used.

The **Celsius** scale (which replaced the slightly different *centigrade* scale)
has the freezing point of water at $$0\text{ºC} $$ and the boiling point at
$$100\text{ºC} $$ . Its unit is the **degree Celsius** $$\left(\text{ºC}\right)
$$ . On the **Fahrenheit** scale (still the most frequently used in the United
States), the freezing point of water is at $$32\text{ºF} $$ and the boiling
point is at $$212\text{ºF} $$ . The unit of temperature on this scale is the **degree Fahrenheit** $$\left(\text{ºF}\right) $$ . Note that a temperature
difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one
degree Fahrenheit. Only 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180
Fahrenheit degrees, thus one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger
than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale $$180/100=9/5\text{.} $$ The **Kelvin**
scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science. It is an *
absolute temperature* scale defined to have 0 K at the lowest possible
temperature, called **absolute zero**. The official temperature unit on this
scale is the **kelvin**, which is abbreviated K, and is not accompanied by a
degree sign. The freezing and boiling points of water are 273.15 K and 373.15 K,
respectively. Thus, the magnitude of temperature differences is the same in
units of kelvins and degrees Celsius. Unlike other temperature scales, the
Kelvin scale is an absolute scale. It is used extensively in scientific work
because a number of physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are
directly related to absolute temperature. The kelvin is the SI unit used in
scientific work.

![Three temperature scales&#x2014;Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin&#x2014;are oriented horizontally, one below the other, and aligned to show how they relate to each other. Absolute zero is at negative four hundred fifty nine point six seven degrees F, negative two hundred seventy three point one five degrees C, and 0 K. Water freezes at thirty two degrees F, 0 degrees C, and two hundred seventy three point one five K. Water boils at two hundred twelve degrees F, one hundred degrees C, and three hundred seventy three point one five K. A temperature difference of 9 degrees F is the same as a temperature difference of 5 degrees C and 5 K.](../resources/Figure_13_01_07.jpg "Relationships between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales, rounded to the nearest degree. The relative sizes of the scales are also shown.")
{ #Figure4}

The relationships between the three common temperature scales is shown
in [[Figure 4]](#Figure4). Temperatures on these scales can be converted using
the equations in [[Table 1]](#Table1).

<table id="Table1" aria-describedby="This table, with three columns, shows the equations to use when converting temperature values between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

Notice that the conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin look quite
complicated. In fact, they are simple combinations of the conversions between
Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the conversions between Celsius and Kelvin.

Converting between Temperature Scales: Room Temperature
</div>
“Room temperature” is generally defined to be  $$25\text{ºC} $$ .
 (a) What is room temperature in  $$\text{ºF} $$ ?
 (b) What is it in K?

**Strategy**

To answer these questions, all we need to do is choose the correct conversion
equations and plug in the known values.

**Solution for (a)**

1. Choose the right equation. To convert from $$\text{ºC} $$ to $$\text{ºF} $$ ,
   use the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}25\text{ºC}+32=77\text{ºF}\text{.} $$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

1. Choose the right equation. To convert from $$\text{ºC} $$ to K, use the
   equation

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}={T}_{\text{ºC}}+ 273.15 \text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{K}}=25\text{ºC}+ 273.15 =298 \text{K}\text{.} $$
</div>
</div>

<div class="title">
Converting between Temperature Scales: the Reaumur Scale
</div>
The Reaumur scale is a temperature scale that was used widely in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. On the Reaumur temperature scale, the freezing point of water is  $$0\text{ºR} $$
 and the boiling temperature is  $$80\text{ºR} $$ .
 If “room temperature” is  $$25\text{ºC} $$
 on the Celsius scale, what is it on the Reaumur scale?

**Strategy**

To answer this question, we must compare the Reaumur scale to the Celsius scale.
The difference between the freezing point and boiling point of water on the
Reaumur scale is $$80\text{ºR} $$ . On the Celsius scale it is $$100\text{ºC} $$
. Therefore $$100\text{ºC}=80\text{ºR} $$ . Both scales start at $$0\text{º} $$
for freezing, so we can derive a simple formula to convert between temperatures
on the two scales.

**Solution**

1. Derive a formula to convert from one scale to the other:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºR}}=\frac{ 0.8\text{ºR}}{\text{ºC}} × {T}_{\text{ºC}}\text{.} $$
</div>
2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:

<div class="equation" >
 $${T}_{\text{ºR}}=\frac{ 0.8\text{ºR}}{\text{ºC}} × 25\text{ºC}=20\text{ºR}\text{.} $$

### Temperature Ranges in the Universe

[[Figure 6]](#Figure6) shows the wide range of temperatures found in the
universe. Human beings have been known to survive with body temperatures within
a small range, from $$24\text{ºC} $$ to $$44\text{ºC} $$ $$\left(75\text{ºF} $$
to $$111\text{ºF} $$ ). The average normal body temperature is usually given as
$$ 37.0\text{ºC} $$
( $$ 98.6\text{ºF} $$ ), and variations in this temperature can indicate a
medical condition: a fever, an infection, a tumor, or circulatory problems (
see [[Figure 5]](#Figure5)).

![This figure consists of four different infrared thermographs of a person\'s head and neck, taken when the person\'s head was positioned at four different angles. The person\'s face and neck are mostly red and orange, with patches of white, green, and yellow. The red and white colors correspond to hot areas. The person\'s hair ranges in color from green to light blue to dark blue. The blue color corresponds to cold areas.](../resources/Figure_13_01_08.jpg "This image of radiation from a person&#x2019;s body (an infrared thermograph) shows the location of temperature abnormalities in the upper body. Dark blue corresponds to cold areas and red to white corresponds to hot areas. An elevated temperature might be an indication of malignant tissue (a cancerous tumor in the breast, for example), while a depressed temperature might be due to a decline in blood flow from a clot. In this case, the abnormalities are caused by a condition called hyperhidrosis. (credit: Porcelina81, Wikimedia Commons)")
{ #Figure5}

The lowest temperatures ever recorded have been measured during laboratory
experiments:  $$ 4.5 \times 10^{-10} \text{K} $$ at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (USA), and $$ 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \text{K} $$ at Helsinki
University of Technology (Finland). In comparison, the coldest recorded place on
Earth’s surface is Vostok, Antarctica at 183 K $$\left(-89\text{ºC}\right) $$ ,
and the coldest place (outside the lab) known in the universe is the Boomerang
Nebula, with a temperature of 1 K.

![The figure is a single vertical axis showing a wide range of temperatures on a logarithmic scale, measured in kelvin. The temperature range goes from the lowest temperature achieved at ten to the power of negative ten kelvin up to the temperature in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at ten to the power of positive twelve kelvin.](../resources/Figure_13_01_05.jpg "Each increment on this logarithmic scale indicates an increase by a factor of ten, and thus illustrates the tremendous range of temperatures in nature.

Making Connections: Absolute Zero
</div>
What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. [[Figure 7]](#Figure7) shows how the pressure of gases at a constant volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature,  $$ - 273.15 \text{ºC} $$ .
 This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called *absolute zero*. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is  $$ - 273.15 \text{ºC} $$
 or 0 K.

Each line extrapolates to a pressure of zero at a temperature of negative two hundred seventy three point one five degrees Celsius.](../resources/Figure_13_01_04.jpg "Graph of pressure versus temperature for various gases kept at a constant volume. Note that all of the graphs extrapolate to zero pressure at the same temperature.")

#### Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Thermometers actually take their **own** temperature, not the temperature of the
object they are measuring. This raises the question of how we can be certain
that a thermometer measures the temperature of the object with which it is in
contact. It is based on the fact that any two systems placed in **thermal
contact** (meaning heat transfer can occur between them) will reach the same
temperature. That is, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one
until they have exactly the same temperature. The objects are then in **thermal
equilibrium**, and no further changes will occur. The systems interact and
change because their temperatures differ, and the changes stop once their
temperatures are the same. Thus, if enough time is allowed for this transfer of
heat to run its course, the temperature a thermometer registers **does**
represent the system with which it is in thermal equilibrium. Thermal
equilibrium is established when two bodies are in contact with each other and
can freely exchange energy.

Furthermore, experimentation has shown that if two systems, A and B, are in
thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a
third system C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This conclusion
may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic
to thermodynamics. It is called the **zeroth law of thermodynamics**.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
</div>
If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

</div>

This law was postulated in the 1930s, after the first and second laws of
thermodynamics had been developed and named. It is called the *zeroth law*
because it comes logically before the first and second laws (discussed
in [Thermodynamics](../contents/ch15Thermodynamics)). An example of this law in action is
seen in babies in incubators: babies in incubators normally have very few
clothes on, so to an observer they look as if they may not be warm enough.
However, the temperature of the air, the cot, and the baby is the same, because
they are in thermal equilibrium, which is accomplished by maintaining air
temperature to keep the baby comfortable.

* Temperature is the quantity measured by a thermometer.
* Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in
  a system.
* Absolute zero is the temperature at which there is no molecular motion.
* There are three main temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
* Temperatures on one scale can be converted to temperatures on another scale
  using the following equations:
  <div class="equation" >
   $${T}_{\text{ºF}}=\frac{9}{5}{T}_{\text{ºC}}+32 $$
  </div>

  <div class="equation" >
   $${T}_{\text{ºC}}=\frac{5}{9}\left({T}_{\text{ºF}}-32\right) $$

  </div>

* Systems are in thermal equilibrium when they have the same temperature.
* Thermal equilibrium occurs when two bodies are in contact with each other and
  can freely exchange energy.
* The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that when two systems, A and B, are in
  thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a
  third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

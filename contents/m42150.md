### Nonconservative Forces and Friction

Forces are either conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces were
discussed in [Conservative Forces and Potential Energy](/contents/m42149). A 
**nonconservative force**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2125883} is one for
which work depends on the path taken. Friction is a good example of a
nonconservative

force. As illustrated in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2415636), work done against
friction depends on the length of the path between the starting and ending
points. Because of this dependence on path, there is no potential energy
associated with nonconservative forces. An important characteristic is that the
work done by a nonconservative force *adds or removes mechanical energy from a
system*. **Friction**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2182205}, for example,
creates **thermal energy**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id2697468} that
dissipates, removing energy from the system. Furthermore, even if the thermal
energy is retained or captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it
is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well.

(b) A drawing of a happy face is erased in the shape of the letter u, but starting from the same point A and ending at the same point B.](../resources/Figure_08_05_01ab1.jpg "The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B, as does the work done against friction. Less work is done and less of the face is erased for the path in (a) than for the path in (b). The force here is friction, and most of the work goes into thermal energy that subsequently leaves the system (the happy face plus the eraser). The energy expended cannot be fully recovered. ")

### How Nonconservative Forces Affect Mechanical Energy

*Mechanical* energy *may* not be conserved when nonconservative forces act. For
example, when a car is brought to a stop by friction on level ground, it loses
kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its mechanical
energy. [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2096889) compares the effects of conservative
and nonconservative forces. We often choose to understand simpler systems such
as that described in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2096889)(a) first before studying
more complicated systems as in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2096889)(b).

![(a) A system is shown in three situations. First, a rock is dropped onto a spring attached to the ground. The rock has potential energy P E sub 0 at the highest point before it is dropped on the spring. In the second situation, the rock has fallen onto the spring and the spring is compressed and has potential energy P E sub s. And in the third situation, the spring pushes the rock into the air; then the rock has some kinetic and some potential energy, labeled as K E plus P E sub g prime. (b) A rock is at some height above the ground, having potential energy P E sub g, and as it hits the ground all of the rock&#x2019;s energy is used to produce heat, sound, and deformation of the ground.](../resources/Figure_08_05_02a.jpg "Comparison of the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces on the mechanical energy of a system. (a) A system with only conservative forces. When a rock is dropped onto a spring, its mechanical energy remains constant (neglecting air resistance) because the force in the spring is conservative. The spring can propel the rock back to its original height, where it once again has only potential energy due to gravity.
(b) A system with nonconservative forces. When the same rock is dropped onto the ground, it is stopped by nonconservative forces that dissipate its mechanical energy as thermal energy, sound, and surface distortion. The rock has lost mechanical energy. ")

### How the Work-Energy Theorem Applies

Now let us consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when both
conservative and nonconservative forces act. We will see that the work done by
nonconservative forces equals the change in the mechanical energy of a system.
As noted in [Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem](/contents/m42147), the
work-energy theorem states that the net work on a system equals the change in
its kinetic energy, or $$ W_{\text{net}}=\Delta \KE $$. The net work is the sum
of the work by nonconservative forces plus the work by conservative forces. That
is,

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{net}}= W_{\text{nc}}+ W_{\text{c}}, $$ 
</div>

so that

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{nc}}+ W_{c}=\Delta \KE, $$ 
</div>

where $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$ is the total work done by all nonconservative forces
and $$ W_{\text{c}} $$ is the total work done by all conservative forces.

![A person pushing a heavy box up an incline. A force F p applied by the person is shown by a vector pointing up the incline. And frictional force f is shown by a vector pointing down the incline, acting on the box.](../resources/Figure_08_05_03a.jpg "A person pushes a crate up a ramp, doing work on the crate. Friction and gravitational force (not shown) also do work on the crate; both forces oppose the person&#x2019;s push. As the crate is pushed up the ramp, it gains mechanical energy, implying that the work done by the person is greater than the work done by friction.")
{: #import-auto-id2124288}

Consider [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2124288), in which a person pushes a crate up
a ramp and is opposed by friction. As in the previous section, we note that work
done by a conservative force comes from a loss of gravitational potential
energy, so that $$ W_{\text{c}}=-\Delta \PE $$. Substituting this equation
into the previous one and solving for $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$ gives

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ W_{\text{nc}}=\Delta \KE+\Delta \PE . $$ 
</div>

This equation means that the total mechanical energy $$ \left(\KE + \PE \right) $$ 
changes by exactly the amount of work done by nonconservative
forces. In [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2124288), this is the work done by the
person minus the work done by friction. So even if energy is not conserved for
the system of interest (
such as the crate), we know that an equal amount of work was done to cause the
change in total mechanical energy.

We rearrange $$ W_{\text{nc}}=\Delta \KE+\Delta \PE $$ to obtain

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+ W_{\text{nc}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}. $$ 
</div>

This means that the amount of work done by nonconservative forces adds to the
mechanical energy of a system. If $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$ is positive, then
mechanical energy is increased, such as when the person pushes the crate up the
ramp in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2124288). If $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$ is negative,
then mechanical energy is decreased, such as when the rock hits the ground
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2096889)(b). If $$ W_{\text{nc}} $$ is zero, then
mechanical energy is conserved, and nonconservative forces are balanced. For
example, when you push a lawn mower at constant speed on level ground, your work
done is removed by the work of friction, and the mower has a constant energy.

### Applying Energy Conservation with Nonconservative Forces

When no change in potential energy occurs, applying $$ \KE_
{\text{i}}+\PE_{\text{i}}+ W_{\text{nc}}=\KE_
{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}} $$ amounts to applying the work-energy theorem
by setting the change in kinetic energy to be equal to the net work done on the
system, which in the most general case includes both conservative and
nonconservative forces. But when seeking instead to find a change in total
mechanical energy in situations that involve changes in both potential and
kinetic energy, the previous equation $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_
{\text{i}}+ W_{\text{nc}}=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}} $$ says
that you can start by finding the change in mechanical energy that would have
resulted from just the conservative forces, including the potential energy
changes, and add to it the work done, with the proper sign, by any
nonconservative forces involved.

Calculating Distance Traveled: How Far a Baseball Player Slides
</div>
Consider the situation shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1908314), where a baseball player slides to a stop on level ground. Using energy considerations, calculate the distance the 65.0-kg baseball player slides, given that his initial speed is 6.00 m/s and the force of friction against him is a constant 450 N.

![A baseball player slides to stop in a distance d. the displacement d is shown by a vector towards the left and frictional force f on the player is shown by a small vector pointing towards the right equal to four hundred and fifty newtons. K E is equal to half m v squared, which is equal to f times d.](../resources/Figure_08_05_04a.jpg "The baseball player slides to a stop in a distance  \( d \) . In the process, friction removes the player&#x2019;s kinetic energy by doing an amount of work fd size 12{ ital &quot;fd&quot;} {} equal to the initial kinetic energy. ")
{: #import-auto-id1908314 height="200"}

**Strategy**

Friction stops the player by converting his kinetic energy into other forms,
including thermal energy. In terms of the work-energy theorem, the work done by
friction, which is negative, is added to the initial kinetic energy to reduce it
to zero. The work done by friction is negative, because $$ \vb{f} $$
is in the opposite direction of the motion (that is, $$ \theta =180^\circ $$,
and so $$ \cos{\theta} =-1 $$).
Thus $$ W_{\text{nc}}=-F d $$. The equation simplifies to

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2}-f d =0 $$ 
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ f d =\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2}. $$ 
</div>
This equation can now be solved for the distance  $$ d $$ .

**Solution**

Solving the previous equation for $$ d $$ and substituting known values yields

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
d& =& \frac{m v_{i}^{2}}{2f}\\ 
 & =& \frac{ \left(65.0 \kg \right)\left(6.00  \ms  \right)^{2}}
{\left(2\right)\left(450 \N \right)}\\
 & =& 2.60 \m  .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

The most important point of this example is that the amount of nonconservative
work equals the change in mechanical energy. For example, you must work harder
to stop a truck, with its large mechanical energy, than to stop a mosquito.

Calculating Distance Traveled: Sliding Up an Incline
</div>
Suppose that the player from [\[link\]](#fs-id1900640) is running up a hill having a  $$ 5.00^\circ $$ 

incline upward with a surface similar to that in the baseball stadium. The
player slides with the same initial speed, and the frictional force is still 450
N. Determine how far he slides.

![A baseball player slides on an inclined slope represented by a right triangle. The angle of the slope is represented by the angle between the base and the hypotenuse, which is equal to five degrees, and the height h of the perpendicular side of the triangle is equal to d sin 5 degrees. The length of the hypotenuse is d.](../resources/Figure_08_05_05a.jpg "The same baseball player slides to a stop on a 5.00&#xBA; size 12{5&#xB0;} {} slope.")
{: #import-auto-id1415046 height="150"}

**Strategy**

In this case, the work done by the nonconservative friction force on the player
reduces the mechanical energy he has from his kinetic energy at zero height, to
the final mechanical energy he has by moving through distance $$ d $$ to reach
height $$ h $$ along the hill, with $$ h=d\sin{5.00^\circ} $$. This is expressed
by the equation

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \KE_{\text{i}}+\PE_\text{i}+ W_{\text{nc}}
=\KE_{\text{f}}+\PE_{\text{f}}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution**

The work done by friction is again $$ W_{\text{nc}}=-f d $$ ; initially the
potential energy is $$ \PE_{i}=mg \cdot 0=0 $$ and the kinetic energy is
$$ \KE_{i}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} $$ ; the final energy contributions
are $$ \KE_{f}=0 $$ for the kinetic energy and $$ \PE_{f}=mgh
=\text{mgd}\sin{\theta} $$ for the potential energy.

Substituting these values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-652">
 $$ \frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2}+0+\left(-f d \right)=0+ m g d \sin{\theta} . $$ 
</div>
Solve this for  $$ d $$ to obtain

<div data-type="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
d& =& \frac{ \frac{1}{2} mv_\text{i}^{2} }
{f+mg \sin{\theta} }\\
 & =& \frac{ \text{(0.5)}\left(65.0 \kg \right)
\left(6.00  \ms  \right)^{2}}
{450 \N +\left(65.0 \kg \right)
\left( 9.80 \mss \right){\sin{(5.00^\circ )}}}\\
 & =& 2.31 \m  .
\end{array} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

As might have been expected, the player slides a shorter distance by sliding
uphill. Note that the problem could also have been solved in terms of the forces
directly and the work energy theorem, instead of using the potential energy.
This method would have required combining the normal force and force of gravity
vectors, which no longer cancel each other because they point in different
directions, and friction, to find the net force. You could then use the net
force and the net work to find the distance $$ d $$ that reduces the kinetic
energy to zero. By applying conservation of energy and using the potential
energy instead, we need only consider the gravitational potential energy $$ mgh
$$, without combining and resolving force vectors. This simplifies the solution
considerably.

Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Determining Friction from the Stopping Distance
</div>
This experiment involves the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. Use the ruler, book, and marble from [Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy](/contents/m42148#fs-id1804087). In addition, you will need a foam cup with a small hole in the side, as shown in [\[link\]](#fs-id1774418). From the 10-cm position on the ruler, let the marble roll into the cup positioned at the bottom of the ruler. Measure the distance  $$ d $$ 

the cup moves before stopping. What forces caused it to stop? What happened to
the kinetic energy of the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Next, place the
marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the distance the
cup moves after the marble enters it. Plot the distance the cup moves versus the
initial marble position on the ruler. Is this relationship linear?

With some simple assumptions, you can use these data to find the coefficient of
kinetic friction $$ \mu_{k} $$ of the cup on the table. The force of friction $$ f $$
on the cup is $$ \mu_{k}N $$, where the normal force $$ N $$ is just the weight
of the cup plus the marble. The normal force and force of gravity do no work
because they are perpendicular to the displacement of the cup, which moves
horizontally. The work done by friction is $$ f d $$. You will need the mass of
the marble as well to calculate its initial kinetic energy.

It is interesting to do the above experiment also with a steel marble (or ball
bearing). Releasing it from the same positions on the ruler as you did with the
glass marble, is the velocity of this steel marble the same as the velocity of
the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Is the distance the cup moves
proportional to the mass of the steel and glass marbles?

At the bottom of the ramp is a foam drinking cup standing upside-down on its lip. A hole is cut out on one side of the cup so that the marble will roll through the hole when it reaches the bottom of the ramp.](../resources/Figure_08_05_06a.jpg "Rolling a marble down a ruler into a foam cup.")

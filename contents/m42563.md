### Ionizing Radiation

A photon is a quantum of EM radiation. Its energy is given by $$E= hf $$ and is
related to the frequency $$f $$ and wavelength $$\lambda $$ of the radiation by

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda }\text{(energy of a photon),} $$
</div>

where $$E $$ is the energy of a single photon and $$c $$ is the speed of
light. When working with small systems, energy in eV is often useful. Note that
Planck’s constant in these units is

<div class="equation" >
 $$h= 4.14  \times 10^{-15} \text{eV}\cdot \text{s}. $$
</div>

Since many wavelengths are stated in nanometers (nm), it is also useful to know
that

<div class="equation" >
 $$hc=1240 \text{eV}\cdot \text{nm}. $$
</div>

These will make many calculations a little easier.

All EM radiation is composed of photons. [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) shows various
divisions of the EM spectrum plotted against wavelength, frequency, and photon
energy. Previously in this book, photon characteristics were alluded to in the
discussion of some of the characteristics of UV, x rays, and $$\gamma $$ rays,
the first of which start with frequencies just above violet in the visible
spectrum. It was noted that these types of EM radiation have characteristics
much different than visible light. We can now see that such properties arise
because photon energy is larger at high frequencies.

![An electromagnetic spectrum is shown. Different types of radiation are indicated using double-sided arrows based on the ranges of their wavelength, energy, and frequency; the visible spectrum is shown, which is a very narrow band. The radio wave region is further segmented into A M radio, F M radio, and Microwaves bands.](../resources/Figure 30_03_01a.jpg "The EM spectrum, showing major categories as a function of photon energy in eV, as well as wavelength and frequency. Certain characteristics of EM radiation are directly attributable to photon energy alone.")

Photons act as individual quanta and interact with individual electrons, atoms,
molecules, and so on. The energy a photon carries is, thus, crucial to the
effects it has. [[Table 1]](#Table1) lists representative submicroscopic
energies in eV. When we compare photon energies from the EM spectrum
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) with energies in the table, we can see how effects
vary with the type of EM radiation.

**Gamma rays**, a form of nuclear and cosmic EM radiation, can have the highest
frequencies and, hence, the highest photon energies in the EM spectrum. For
example, a $$\gamma $$ -ray photon with $$f{= 10}^{21} \text{Hz} $$ has an
energy $$E= hf=6.63 \times 10^{-13} \text{J}=4.14 \text{MeV} \text{.} $$ This is
sufficient energy to ionize thousands of atoms and molecules, since only 10 to
1000 eV are needed per ionization. In fact, $$\gamma $$ rays are one type of **ionizing radiation**, as are x rays and UV, because they produce ionization in
materials that absorb them. Because so much ionization can be produced, a single
$$\gamma $$ -ray photon can cause significant damage to biological tissue,
killing cells or damaging their ability to properly reproduce. When cell
reproduction is disrupted, the result can be cancer, one of the known effects of
exposure to ionizing radiation. Since cancer cells are rapidly reproducing, they
are exceptionally sensitive to the disruption produced by ionizing radiation.
This means that ionizing radiation has positive uses in cancer treatment as well
as risks in producing cancer.

The hand belongs to Bertha R&#xF6;entgen, his wife. (credit: Wilhelm Conrad R&#xF6;ntgen, via Wikimedia Commons)")
{: #Figure2}

High photon energy also enables $$\gamma $$ rays to penetrate materials, since a
collision with a single atom or molecule is unlikely to absorb all the $$\gamma
$$ ray’s energy. This can make $$\gamma $$ rays useful as a probe, and they are
sometimes used in medical imaging. **x rays**, as you can see
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1), overlap with the low-frequency end of the $$\gamma $$
ray range. Since x rays have energies of keV and up, individual x-ray photons
also can produce large amounts of ionization. At lower photon energies, x rays
are not as penetrating as $$\gamma $$ rays and are slightly less hazardous. X
rays are ideal for medical imaging, their most common use, and a fact that was
recognized immediately upon their discovery in 1895 by the German physicist W.
C. Roentgen (1845–1923). (See [[Figure 2]](#Figure2).) Within one year of their
discovery, x rays (for a time called Roentgen rays) were used for medical
diagnostics. Roentgen received the 1901 Nobel Prize for the discovery of x rays.

Connections: Conservation of Energy
</div>
Once again, we find that conservation of energy allows us to consider the initial and final forms that energy takes, without having to make detailed calculations of the intermediate steps. [[link]](#fs-id1558291) is solved by considering only the initial and final forms of energy.

</div>

![A cathode ray tube connected to a high-voltage source is shown in the figure. The image shows electrons coming out of the heated filament at one end of the vacuum tube as tiny balls, and hitting the metal plate at the opposite end of the vacuum tube. X rays are shown coming out from the metal plate in the form of waves.](../resources/Figure 30_03_03a.jpg "X rays are produced when energetic electrons strike the copper anode of this cathode ray tube (CRT). Electrons (shown here as separate particles) interact individually with the material they strike, sometimes producing photons of EM radiation.")
{: #Figure3}

While $$\gamma $$ rays originate in nuclear decay, x rays are produced by the
process shown in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3). Electrons ejected by thermal agitation
from a hot filament in a vacuum tube are accelerated through a high voltage,
gaining kinetic energy from the electrical potential energy. When they strike
the anode, the electrons convert their kinetic energy to a variety of forms,
including thermal energy. But since an accelerated charge radiates EM waves, and
since the electrons act individually, photons are also produced. Some of these
x-ray photons obtain the kinetic energy of the electron. The accelerated
electrons originate at the cathode, so such a tube is called a cathode ray
tube (CRT), and various versions of them are found in older TV and computer
screens as well as in x-ray machines.

X-ray Photon Energy and X-ray Tube Voltage
</div>
Find the maximum energy in eV of an x-ray photon produced by electrons accelerated through a potential difference of 50.0 kV in a CRT like the one in [[Figure 3]](#Figure3).

**Strategy**

Electrons can give all of their kinetic energy to a single photon when they
strike the anode of a CRT. (This is something like the photoelectric effect in
reverse.) The kinetic energy of the electron comes from electrical potential
energy. Thus we can simply equate the maximum photon energy to the electrical
potential energy—that is, $$ hf=qV  \text{.} $$
(We do not have to calculate each step from beginning to end if we know that all
of the starting energy $$qV $$ is converted to the final form $$\text{hf}
\text{.} $$ )

**Solution**

The maximum photon energy is $$ hf=qV $$ , where $$q $$ is the charge of the
electron and $$\text{V} $$ is the accelerating voltage. Thus,

<div class="equation" >
 $$ hf=\left( 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)\left( 50.0 \times 10^{3}  \text{V}\right)\text{.} $$
</div>
From the definition of the electron volt, we know  $$1 \text{eV}= 1.60  \times 10^{-19} \text{J} $$ ,
 where  $$1 \text{J}=1 \text{C} \cdot \text{V}. $$
 Gathering factors and converting energy to eV yields

<div class="equation" >
 $$ hf=\left( 50.0 \times 10^{3} \right)\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\cdot \text{V}\right)\left(\frac{1 \text{eV}}{1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\cdot \text{V}}\right)=\left( 50.0 \times 10^{3} \right)\left(1 \text{eV}\right)=50.0 \text{keV} \text{.}  $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This example produces a result that can be applied to many similar situations.
If you accelerate a single elementary charge, like that of an electron, through
a potential given in volts, then its energy in eV has the same numerical value.
Thus a 50.0-kV potential generates 50.0 keV electrons, which in turn can produce
photons with a maximum energy of 50 keV. Similarly, a 100-kV potential in an
x-ray tube can generate up to 100-keV x-ray photons. Many x-ray tubes have
adjustable voltages so that various energy x rays with differing energies, and
therefore differing abilities to penetrate, can be generated.

![A graph for X-ray intensity versus frequency is shown. Frequency is plotted along x axis and intensity along y axis. The curve has a smooth rise up then at highest point it has two peaks and ends smoothly at f sub max. q V is equal to h f sub max is written in the graph.](../resources/Figure 30_03_04a.jpg "X-ray spectrum obtained when energetic electrons strike a material. The smooth part of the spectrum is bremsstrahlung, while the peaks are characteristic of the anode material. Both are atomic processes that produce energetic photons known as x-ray photons.")
{: #Figure4}

[[Figure 4]](#Figure4) shows the spectrum of x rays obtained from an x-ray tube.
There are two distinct features to the spectrum. First, the smooth distribution
results from electrons being decelerated in the anode material. A curve like
this is obtained by detecting many photons, and it is apparent that the maximum
energy is unlikely. This decelerating process produces radiation that is
called **bremsstrahlung** (German for *braking radiation*). The second feature
is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum; these are called **characteristic x rays**, since they are characteristic of the anode material.
Characteristic x rays come from atomic excitations unique to a given type of
anode material. They are akin to lines in atomic spectra, implying the energy
levels of atoms are quantized. Phenomena such as discrete atomic spectra and
characteristic x rays are explored further in [Atomic Physics](/m42585).

**Ultraviolet radiation** (approximately 4 eV to 300 eV) overlaps with the low
end of the energy range of x rays, but UV is typically lower in energy. UV comes
from the de-excitation of atoms that may be part of a hot solid or gas. These
atoms can be given energy that they later release as UV by numerous processes,
including electric discharge, nuclear explosion, thermal agitation, and exposure
to x rays. A UV photon has sufficient energy to ionize atoms and molecules,
which makes its effects different from those of visible light. UV thus has some
of the same biological effects as $$\gamma $$ rays and x rays. For example, it
can cause skin cancer and is used as a sterilizer. The major difference is that
several UV photons are required to disrupt cell reproduction or kill a
bacterium, whereas single $$\gamma $$ -ray and X-ray photons can do the same
damage. But since UV does have the energy to alter molecules, it can do what
visible light cannot. One of the beneficial aspects of UV is that it triggers
the production of vitamin D in the skin, whereas visible light has insufficient
energy per photon to alter the molecules that trigger this production. Infantile
jaundice is treated by exposing the baby to UV (with eye protection), called
phototherapy, the beneficial effects of which are thought to be related to its
ability to help prevent the buildup of potentially toxic bilirubin in the blood.

Photon Energy and Effects for UV
</div>
Short-wavelength UV is sometimes called vacuum UV, because it is strongly absorbed by air and must be studied in a vacuum. Calculate the photon energy in eV for 100-nm vacuum UV, and estimate the number of molecules it could ionize or break apart.

**Strategy**

Using the equation $$E= hf $$ and appropriate constants, we can find the photon
energy and compare it with energy information in [[Table 1]](#Table1).

**Solution**

The energy of a photon is given by

<div class="equation" >
 $$E= hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
Using  $$hc=1240 \text{eV}\cdot \text{nm} \text{,}  $$  we find that

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }=\frac{1240 \text{eV}\cdot \text{nm}}{100 \text{nm}}=12.4 \text{eV}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

According to [[Table 1]](#Table1), this photon energy might be able to ionize an
atom or molecule, and it is about what is needed to break up a tightly bound
molecule, since they are bound by approximately 10 eV. This photon energy could
destroy about a dozen weakly bound molecules. Because of its high photon energy,
UV disrupts atoms and molecules it interacts with. One good consequence is that
all but the longest-wavelength UV is strongly absorbed and is easily blocked by
sunglasses. In fact, most of the Sun’s UV is absorbed by a thin layer of ozone
in the upper atmosphere, protecting sensitive organisms on Earth. Damage to our
ozone layer by the addition of such chemicals as CFC’s has reduced this
protection for us.

</div>

### Visible Light

The range of photon energies for **visible light** from red to violet is 1.63 to
3.26 eV, respectively (left for this chapter’s Problems and Exercises to verify)
. These energies are on the order of those between outer electron shells in
atoms and molecules. This means that these photons can be absorbed by atoms and
molecules. A **single** photon can actually stimulate the retina, for example,
by altering a receptor molecule that then triggers a nerve impulse. Photons can
be absorbed or emitted only by atoms and molecules that have precisely the
correct quantized energy step to do so. For example, if a red photon of
frequency $$f $$ encounters a molecule that has an energy step, $$\Delta E, $$
equal to $$ hf, $$ then the photon can be absorbed. Violet flowers absorb red
and reflect violet; this implies there is no energy step between levels in the
receptor molecule equal to the violet photon’s energy, but there is an energy
step for the red.

There are some noticeable differences in the characteristics of light between
the two ends of the visible spectrum that are due to photon energies. Red light
has insufficient photon energy to expose most black-and-white film, and it is
thus used to illuminate darkrooms where such film is developed. Since violet
light has a higher photon energy, dyes that absorb violet tend to fade more
quickly than those that do not. (See [[Figure 5]](#Figure5).) Take a look at
some faded color posters in a storefront some time, and you will notice that the
blues and violets are the last to fade. This is because other dyes, such as red
and green dyes, absorb blue and violet photons, the higher energies of which
break up their weakly bound molecules. (Complex molecules such as those in dyes
and DNA tend to be weakly bound.) Blue and violet dyes reflect those colors and,
therefore, do not absorb these more energetic photons, thus suffering less
molecular damage.

![Photograph of a worn-out movie advertisement poster on a wall.](../resources/Figure 30_03_05a.jpg "Why do the reds, yellows, and greens fade before the blues and violets when exposed to the Sun, as with this poster? The answer is related to photon energy. (credit: Deb Collins, Flickr)")
{: #Figure5}

Transparent materials, such as some glasses, do not absorb any visible light,
because there is no energy step in the atoms or molecules that could absorb the
light. Since individual photons interact with individual atoms, it is nearly
impossible to have two photons absorbed simultaneously to reach a large energy
step. Because of its lower photon energy, visible light can sometimes pass
through many kilometers of a substance, while higher frequencies like UV, x ray,
and $$\gamma $$ rays are absorbed, because they have sufficient photon energy to
ionize the material.

How Many Photons per Second Does a Typical Light Bulb Produce?
</div>
Assuming that 10.0% of a 100-W light bulb’s energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an average wavelength of 580 nm, calculate the number of visible photons emitted per second.

**Strategy**

Power is energy per unit time, and so if we can find the energy per photon, we
can determine the number of photons per second. This will best be done in
joules, since power is given in watts, which are joules per second.

**Solution**

The power in visible light production is 10.0% of 100 W, or 10.0 J/s. The energy
of the average visible photon is found by substituting the given average
wavelength into the formula

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda }. $$
</div>
This produces

<div class="equation" >
 $$E=\frac{\left( 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{J}\cdot \text{s}\right)\left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}  \text{m/s}\right)}{ 580 \times 10^{-9} \text{m}}=3.43 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}. $$
</div>
The number of visible photons per second is thus

<div class="equation" >
 $$\text{photon/s}=\frac{10.0 \text{J/s}}{ 3.43 \times 10^{-19} \text{J/photon}}= 2.92 \times 10^{19}  \text{photon/s}. $$
</div>
**Discussion**

This incredible number of photons per second is verification that individual
photons are insignificant in ordinary human experience. It is also a
verification of the correspondence principle—on the macroscopic scale,
quantization becomes essentially continuous or classical. Finally, there are so
many photons emitted by a 100-W lightbulb that it can be seen by the unaided eye
many kilometers away.

</div>

### Lower-Energy Photons

**Infrared radiation (IR)** has even lower photon energies than visible light
and cannot significantly alter atoms and molecules. IR can be absorbed and
emitted by atoms and molecules, particularly between closely spaced states. IR
is extremely strongly absorbed by water, for example, because water molecules
have many states separated by energies on the order of $$10^{-5} \text{eV} $$ to
$$10^{-2} \text{eV} \text{,} $$ well within the IR and microwave energy ranges.
This is why in the IR range, skin is almost jet black, with an emissivity near
1—there are many states in water molecules in the skin that can absorb a large
range of IR photon energies. Not all molecules have this property. Air, for
example, is nearly transparent to many IR frequencies.

**Microwaves** are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic
circuits, although they are also produced naturally. Thus microwaves are similar
to IR but do not extend to as high frequencies. There are states in water and
other molecules that have the same frequency and energy as microwaves, typically
about $$10^{-5} \text{eV} \text{.} $$ This is one reason why food absorbs
microwaves more strongly than many other materials, making microwave ovens an
efficient way of putting energy directly into food.

Photon energies for both IR and microwaves are so low that huge numbers of
photons are involved in any significant energy transfer by IR or microwaves (
such as warming yourself with a heat lamp or cooking pizza in the microwave).
Visible light, IR, microwaves, and all lower frequencies cannot produce
ionization with single photons and do not ordinarily have the hazards of higher
frequencies. When visible, IR, or microwave radiation **is** hazardous, such as
the inducement of cataracts by microwaves, the hazard is due to huge numbers of
photons acting together (not to an accumulation of photons, such as
sterilization by weak UV). The negative effects of visible, IR, or microwave
radiation can be thermal effects, which could be produced by any heat source.
But one difference is that at very high intensity, strong electric and magnetic
fields can be produced by photons acting together. Such electromagnetic fields (
EMF) can actually ionize materials.

<div class="title">
Misconception Alert: High-Voltage Power Lines
</div>
Although some people think that living near high-voltage power lines is hazardous to one’s health, ongoing studies of the transient field effects produced by these lines show their strengths to be insufficient to cause damage. Demographic studies also fail to show significant correlation of ill effects with high-voltage power lines. The American Physical Society issued a report over 10 years ago on power-line fields, which concluded that the scientific literature and reviews of panels show no consistent, significant link between cancer and power-line fields. They also felt that the “diversion of resources to eliminate a threat which has no persuasive scientific basis is disturbing.”

</div>

It is virtually impossible to detect individual photons having frequencies below
microwave frequencies, because of their low photon energy. But the photons are
there. A continuous EM wave can be modeled as photons. At low frequencies, EM
waves are generally treated as time- and position-varying electric and magnetic
fields with no discernible quantization. This is another example of the
correspondence principle in situations involving huge numbers of photons.

**Construct Your Own Problem**

Consider a laser pen. Construct a problem in which you calculate the number of
photons per second emitted by the pen. Among the things to be considered are the
laser pen’s wavelength and power output. Your instructor may also wish for you
to determine the minimum diffraction spreading in the beam and the number of
photons per square centimeter the pen can project at some large distance. In
this latter case, you will also need to consider the output size of the laser
beam, the distance to the object being illuminated, and any absorption or
scattering along the way.

gamma ray
: also $$\gamma $$ -ray; highest-energy photon in the EM spectrum

ionizing radiation
: radiation that ionizes materials that absorb it

x ray
: EM photon between $$\gamma $$ -ray and UV in energy

bremsstrahlung
: German for *braking radiation*; produced when electrons are decelerated

characteristic x rays
: x rays whose energy depends on the material they were produced in

ultraviolet radiation
: UV; ionizing photons slightly more energetic than violet light

visible light
: the range of photon energies the human eye can detect

infrared radiation
: photons with energies slightly less than red light

microwaves
: photons with wavelengths on the order of a micron (
$$\text{μm} $$ )

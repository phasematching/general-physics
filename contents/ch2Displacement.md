### Position

In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe
its **position**{: data-type="term"} —where it is at any particular time. More
precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference
frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the
position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference
frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position
of the rocket with respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position
could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white
board. ( See [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2972079).) In other cases, we use reference frames
that are not stationary but are in motion relative to the Earth. To describe the
position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not the
Earth, as the reference frame. (
See [[Figure]](#import-auto-id2707699).)

### Displacement

If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a professor
moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the
rear of an airplane), then the object’s position changes. This change in
position is known as **displacement**{: data-type="term"}. The word
“displacement” implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced.

<div data-type="title">
Displacement
</div>
Displacement is the *change in position* of an object:
<div data-type="equation" id="eip-458">
$$ \Delta x=x_{\text{f}}-x_{0},$$
</div>
where $$\Delta x$$ is displacement, $$x_{\text{f}}$$ is the final
position, and $$x_{0} $$ is the initial position.
</div>
In this text the upper case Greek letter $$ \Delta  $$
(delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it; thus, $$
\Delta x $$
means *change in position*. Always solve for displacement by subtracting initial
position $$ x_{0} $$
from final position $$ x_{\text{f}} $$.

Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m) (
see [Physical Quantities and Units](../contents/ch1PhysicalQuantitiesAndUnits.md)), but sometimes
kilometers, miles, feet, and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that
when units other than the meter are used in a problem, you may need to convert
them into meters to complete the calculation.

![The initial and final position of a professor as she moves to the right while writing on a whiteboard. Her initial position is 1 point 5 meters. Her final position is 3 point 5 meters. Her displacement is given by the equation delta x equals x sub f minus x sub 0 equals 2 point 0 meters.](../resources/Figure_02_01_01.jpg "A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by \( \Delta x \) . The +2.0m displacement of the professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.")

![View of an airplane with an inset of the passengers sitting inside.
A passenger has just moved from his seat and is now standing in the back.
His initial position was 6 point 0 meters. His final position is 2 point
0 meters. His displacement is given by the equation delta x equals x sub f minus x sub 0 equals
4 point zero meters.](../resources/Figure_02_01_02.jpg
"A passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane.
His location relative to the airplane is given by \( x_f -x_0 \). The
displacement of the
passenger relative to the plane is represented by an arrow toward the rear of
the plane. Notice that the arrow representing his displacement is twice as long
as the arrow representing the displacement of the professor (he moves twice as far) in [link].")
{: #import-auto-id2707699}

Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The professor’s
displacement is 2.0 m to the right, and the airline passenger’s displacement is
4.0 m toward the rear. In one-dimensional motion, direction can be specified
with a plus or minus sign. When you begin a problem, you should select which
direction is positive (usually that will be to the right or up, but you are free
to select positive as being any direction). The professor’s initial position is
$$ x_{0}=1.5\m $$ and her final position is $$ x_{\text{f}}=3.5\m
$$. Thus her displacement is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-556">
 $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0}=3.5 \m -1.5 \m=+2.0 \m . $$
</div>

In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas motion to
the left is negative. Similarly, the airplane passenger’s initial position is
$$ x_{0}=6.0 \m $$ and his final position is $$ x_{f}=2.0 \m $$, so his displacement
is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-778">
 $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0}=2.0 \m -6.0 \m =-4.0 \m . $$
</div>

His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane,
or in the negative $$ x $$ direction in our coordinate system.

### Distance

Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not.
**Distance**{: data-type="term"} is defined to be *the magnitude or size of
displacement between two positions*. Note that the distance between two
positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them.
**Distance traveled**{: data-type="term"} is *the total length of the path traveled between
two positions*. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the
distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane passenger walks
is 4.0 m.

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement
</div>
It is important to note that the *distance traveled*,
however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement
(by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without
regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit).
For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times,
perhaps walking a distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still
end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case
her displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement
would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m.
In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of
displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think
about this is to assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of
the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of
the two marks and is independent
of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled,
however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks.

(a) The rider’s displacement is $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0}=\text{−1 km} $$. (The
displacement is negative because we take east to be positive and west to be
negative.)

(b) The distance traveled is $$ 3 \text{km}+2 \text{km}=5 \text{km} $$.

(c) The magnitude of the displacement is $$ 1 km $$.

### Section Summary

* Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its causes. In this
  chapter, it is limited to motion along a straight line, called one-dimensional
  motion.
* Displacement is the change in position of an object.
* In symbols, displacement $$ \Delta x $$ is defined to be
  <div data-type="equation">
 $$ \Delta x=x_{f}-x_{0}, $$
  </div>

  where $$ x_{0} $$ is the initial position and $$ x_{f} $$ is the final
  position. In this text, the Greek letter $$ \Delta $$
  (delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it. The SI unit for
  displacement is the meter (m). Displacement has a direction as well as a
  magnitude.
* When you start a problem, assign which direction will be positive.
* Distance is the magnitude of displacement between two positions.
* Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two
  positions.

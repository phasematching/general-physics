We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from
a stop sign, the greater the displacement in a given time. But we have not
developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and displacement. In
this section, we develop some convenient equations for kinematic relationships,
starting from the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration
already covered.

### Notation: *t*, *x*, *v*, *a*

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to
be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification.
Since elapsed time is $$ \Delta t=t_{f}-t_{0} $$, taking $$ t_{0}=0 $$ means
that $$ \Delta t=t_{f} $$, the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is
taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position
and velocity. That is, $$ x_{0} $$ is the *initial position* and $$ v_{0} $$
is the *initial velocity*. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, 
$$ t $$  is the *final time*, $$ x $$ is the *final position*, and
$$ v $$ is the *final velocity*. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed 
time—now, $$ \Delta t=t $$. It also simplifies the expression for displacement, which is
now $$ \Delta x=x-x_{0} $$. Also, it simplifies the expression for change in
velocity, which is now $$ \Delta v=v-v_{0} $$. To summarize, using the
simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2563693">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
\Delta t& =& t\\ 
\Delta x& =& x-x_{0}\\
\Delta v& =& v-v_{0}
\end{array} $$ 
</div>
where *the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript
denotes a final value* in whatever motion is under consideration.

We now make the important assumption that *acceleration is constant*. This
assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration.
Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are
equal. That is,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1819116">
 $$ \overline{a}=a=\text{constant}, $$ 
</div>

so we use the symbol $$ a $$ for acceleration at all times. Assuming
acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we can study
nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration *is*
constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations
we can accurately describe motion by assuming a constant acceleration equal to
the average acceleration for that motion. Finally, in motions where acceleration
changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to
a stop, the motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its
own constant acceleration.

Solving for Displacement (  \( \Delta x \) ) and Final Position (
 \( x \) ) from Average Velocity when Acceleration ( \( a \) ) is Constant
</div>
To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1782525">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ \Delta x}{\Delta t}. $$ 
</div>
Substituting the simplified notation for  $$ \Delta x $$ and $$ \Delta t $$
yields

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id4145482">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{x-x_{0}}{t}. $$ 
</div>
Solving for  $$ x $$ yields

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2297251">
 $$ x=x_{0}+\overline{v}t, $$ 
</div>
where the average velocity is

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2086556">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ v_{0}+v}{2}\left(\text{constant}a\right). $$ 
</div>
</div>

The equation $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ v_{0}+v}{2} $$ reflects the fact that, when
acceleration is constant, $$ v $$ is just the simple average of the initial and
final velocities. For example, if you steadily increase your velocity (
that is, with constant acceleration) from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average
velocity during this steady increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation $$
\overline{v}=\frac{ v_{0}+v}{2} $$ to check this, we see that

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id4152098">
 $$ \overline{v}=\frac{ v_{0}+v}{2}=\frac{30 \text{km/h}+60 \text{km/h}}{2}=45  \text{km/h,} $$ 
</div>

which seems logical.

Calculating Displacement: How Far does the Jogger Run?
</div>
A jogger runs down a straight stretch of road with an average velocity of 4.00 m/s for 2.00 min. What is his final position, 
taking his initial position to be zero?

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![Velocity vector arrow labeled v equals 4 point zero zero meters per second over an x axis displaying initial and final positions. Final position is labeled x equals question mark.](../resources/Figure_02_05_00a.jpg)

The final position $$ x $$ is given by the equation

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2168543">
 $$ x=x_{0}+\overline{v}t. $$ 
</div>
To find  $$ x $$, we identify the values of $$ x_{0} $$,  $$ \overline{v} $$,
and $$ t $$ from the statement of the problem and substitute them into the equation.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ \overline{v}=4.00 \text{m/s} $$, $$ \Delta t=2.00
\text{min} $$, and $$ x_{0}=0 \text{m} $$.

2\. Enter the known values into the equation.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2300752">
 $$ x=x_{0}+\overline{v}t=0+\left(4.00 \text{m/s}\right)\left(120 \text{s}\right)=480 \text{m} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

Velocity and final displacement are both positive, which means they are in the
same direction.

</div>

The equation $$ x=x_{0}+\overline{v}t $$ gives insight into the relationship
between displacement, average velocity, and time. It shows, for example, that
displacement is a linear function of average velocity. (By linear function, we
mean that displacement depends on  $$ \overline{v} $$
 rather than on  $$ \overline{v} $$
 raised to some other power, such as  $$ {\overline{v}}^{2} $$
  . When graphed, linear functions look like straight lines with a constant
  slope.) On a car trip, for example, we will get twice as far in a given time
  if we average 90 km/h than if we average 45 km/h.

Calculating Final Velocity: An Airplane Slowing Down after Landing
</div>
An airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and then decelerates at  $$ 1.50 \text{m/s}^2 $$ for 40.0 s. What is its final velocity?

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch. We draw the acceleration vector in the direction opposite the
velocity vector because the plane is decelerating.

![Velocity vector arrow pointing toward the right in the positive x direction. Initial velocity equals seventy meters per second. Final velocity equals question mark. An acceleration vector arrow pointing toward the left labeled a equals negative 1 point 50 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_05_00c.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id2300963}

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. $$ v_{0}=70.0 \text{m/s} $$, $$ a=-1.50 \text{m/s}^2
$$, $$ t=40.0\text{s} $$.

2\. Identify the unknown. In this case, it is final velocity, $$ v_{f} $$. 

3\. Determine which equation to use. We can calculate the final velocity using
the equation $$ v=v_{0}+a t $$.

4\. Plug in the known values and solve.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2177855">
 $$ v=v_{0}+a t  =70.0 \text{m/s}+\left(-1.50 \text{m/s}^2\right)\left(40.0 \text{s}\right)=10.0 \text{m/s} $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when
slowing down, but still positive. With jet engines, reverse thrust could be
maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward. That
would be indicated by a negative final velocity, which is not the case here.

The acceleration vector arrow points toward the left and is labeled negative 1 point 5 meters per second squared.

The acceleration vector arrow is still pointing toward the left and is labeled a equals negative 1 point 5 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_04_01.jpg "The airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and slows to a final velocity of 10.0 m/s before heading for the terminal.

</div>

In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation $$ v=v_{0}+a t $$
gives us insight into the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time.
From it we can see, for example, that

* {: #import-auto-id2180047} final velocity depends on how large the
  acceleration is and how long it lasts
* {: #import-auto-id2180050} if the acceleration is zero, then the final
  velocity equals the initial velocity $$ \left(   v=v_{0}\right) $$,
  as expected (i.e., velocity is constant)
* {: #import-auto-id2175665} if  $$ a $$ is negative, then the final velocity is less than 
  the initial velocity

(All of these observations fit our intuition, and it is always useful to examine
basic equations in light of our intuition and experiences to check that they do
indeed describe nature accurately.)

An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has a larger average acceleration
than the Space Shuttle and achieves a greater velocity in the first minute or
two of flight (actual ICBM burn times are classified—short-burn-time missiles
are more difficult for an enemy to destroy). But the Space Shuttle obtains a
greater final velocity, so that it can orbit the earth rather than come directly
back down as an ICBM does. The Space Shuttle does this by accelerating for a
longer time.

Solving for Final Position When Velocity is Not Constant ( i.e acceleration is not zero)

We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2166975">
 $$ v=v_{0}+a t . $$

Adding  $$ v_{0} $$ to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

 $$ \overline{v}=v_{0}+\frac{1}{2}a t . $$

Dragsters can achieve average accelerations of  $$ 26.0 \text{m/s}^2 $$ . Suppose such a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate for 5.56 s. How far
does it travel in this time?

![Dragster accelerating down a race track.](../resources/Figure_02_04_02.jpg "U.S. Army Top Fuel pilot Tony &#x201C;The Sarge&#x201D; Schumacher begins a race with a controlled burnout. (credit: Lt. Col. William Thurmond. Photo Courtesy of U.S. Army.)  ")

We are asked to find displacement, which is $$ x $$ if we take $$ x_{0} $$ to be
zero. (Think about it like the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but
we call it 0 and measure all other positions relative to it.) We can use the
equation $$ x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}a t^{2} $$
**once we identify $$ v_{0} $$, $$ a $$, and $$ t $$ from the statement of the
problem.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that $$ v_{0}=0 $$,  $$a $$
is given as $$ 26.0\text{m/s}^{2} $$ and $$ t $$ is given as 5.56 s.

2\. Plug the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown $$ x $$ :

 $$ x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}a t^{2} . $$

**Discussion**

If we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to
one quarter of a mile, the standard distance for drag racing. So the answer is
reasonable. This is an impressive displacement in only 5.56 s, but top-notch
dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this.

What else can we learn by examining the equation $$ x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}a

The equation $$ v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a\left(x-x_{0}\right) $$ is ideally suited to
this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and displacement, and no
time information is required.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the known values. We know that $$ v_{0}=0 $$, since the dragster
starts from rest. Then we note that $$ x-x_{0}=402 \text{m} $$
(this was the answer in [\[link\]](#fs-id1164906457202)). Finally, the average
acceleration was given to be $$ a=26.0 \text{m/s}^2 $$.

2\. Plug the knowns into the equation $$ v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a\left(x-x_

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1680164">
 $$ v^{2}=0+2 \left(26.0 \text{m/s}^2\right) \left(402 \text{m}\right) . $$

 $$ v=\sqrt{2.09 \times 10^{4}\text{m}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}}=145 \text{m/s} . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

145 m/s is about 522 km/h or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is
short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two
values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same direction
as the acceleration.

</div>

An examination of the equation $$ v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a\left(x-x_{0}\right)
$$ can produce further insights into the general relationships among physical
quantities:

* {: #import-auto-id1680053} The final velocity depends on how large the
  acceleration is and the distance over which it acts
* {: #import-auto-id1680020} For a fixed deceleration, a car that is going twice

  stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)

{: #import-auto-id2174020}

In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all of
the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for. We shall do
this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables to set them off.

**Solution for (a)**

1\. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $$ v_{0}=30.0 \text{m/s}$$;
$$ v=0 $$ ; $$ a=-7.00\text{m/s}^{2} $$
( $$ a $$ is negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We
take $$ x_{0} $$ to be 0. We are looking for displacement $$ \Delta x $$, or $$ x-x_{0} $$.

2\. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best equation
to use is

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2180580">
 $$ v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a\left(x-x_{0}\right). $$ 
</div>
This equation is best because it includes only one unknown,  $$ x $$ . We know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (There are
other equations that would allow us to solve for $$ x $$, but they require us to know the stopping time, $$ t $$, which we do not know. We could use them but it would entail additional
calculations.)

3\. Rearrange the equation to solve for $$ x $$.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id4179294">
 $$ x-x_{0}=\frac{ v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2a} $$ 
</div>

4\. Enter known values.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2293184">
 $$ x-0=\frac{ {0}^{2}-{\left(30.0 \text{m/s}\right)}^{2}}{2\left(-7.00 \text{m/s}^2\right)} $$ 
</div>
Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2293155">
 $$ x=64.3 \text{m} \text{ on dry concrete}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (b)**

This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as Part A. The only
difference is that the deceleration is $$ –5.00 \text{m/s}^2 $$. The result is

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2178635">
 $$ x_{\text{wet}}=90.0 \text{m}$$ \text{ on wet concrete}. $$ 
</div>

**Solution for (c)**

Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in Parts A
and B for dry and wet concrete. So to answer this question, we need to calculate
how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the
stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the velocity remains constant
during the driver’s reaction time.

1\. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $$
\overline{v}=30.0 \text{m/s} $$ ; $$ t_{\text{reaction}}=0.500\text{s} $$ ; $$
a_{\text{reaction}}=0 $$. We take $$ x_{0-\text{reaction}} $$ to be 0. We are
looking for $$ x_{\text{reaction}} $$.

2\. Identify the best equation to use.

$$ x=x_{0}+\overline{v}t $$ works well because the only unknown value is $$ x
$$, which is what we want to solve for.

3\. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2175306">
 $$ x=0+\left(30.0 \text{m/s}\right)\left(0.500 \text{s}\right)=15.0 \text{m}. $$ 
</div>
This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete 15.0 m greater than if he reacted instantly.

4\. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when
braking.

**Discussion**

The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a
fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet rather than dry
pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the
displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving problems.
We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined and then find an
appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The
various parts of this example can in fact be solved by other methods, but the
solutions presented above are the shortest.

Calculating Time: A Car Merges into Traffic
</div>
Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a 200-m-long ramp. 
If its initial velocity is 10.0 m/s and it accelerates at  $$ 2.00 \text{m/s}^2 $$,
how long does it take to travel the 200 m up the ramp? 
(Such information might be useful to a traffic engineer.)

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![A line segment with ends labeled x subs zero equals zero and x = two hundred. Above the line segment, the equation t equals question mark indicates that time is unknown. Three vectors, all pointing in the direction of x equals 200, represent the other knowns and unknowns. They are labeled v sub zero equals ten point zero meters per second, v equals question mark, and a equals two point zero zero meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_04_03a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id2296882}

We are asked to solve for the time $$ t $$. As before, we identify the known
quantities in order to choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an
equation with one unknown, $$ t $$). 


**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that $$ v_{0}=10
\text{m/s} $$ ; $$ a=2.00 \text{m/s}^2 $$ ; and $$ x=200 \text{m} $$.

2\. We need to solve for $$ t $$. Choose the best equation. $$ x=x_{0}+v_
{0}t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} $$ works best because the only unknown in the equation
is the variable $$ t $$ for which we need to solve.

3\. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for $$ t $$. In this case,
it will be easier to plug in the knowns first.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2179013">
 $$ 200 \text{m}=0 \text{m}+\left(10.0 \text{m/s}\right)t+\frac{1}{2}\left(2.00 \text{m/s}^2\right){t}^{2} $$ 
</div>
4\. Simplify the equation. The units of meters (m) cancel because they are in each term.
We can get the units of seconds (s) to cancel by taking  $$ t=t\text{s} $$, where $$ t $$
is the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-635">
 $$ 200 =10 t+ t^{2}. $$ 
</div>
5\. Use the quadratic formula to solve for  $$ t $$. 
(a) Rearrange the equation to get 0 on one side of the equation.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1680208">
 $$ t^{2}+10 t-200 =0 $$ 
</div>
This is a quadratic equation of the form

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1680214">
 $$ a t^{2} + b t +c=0, $$ 
</div>
where the constants are  $$ a=1.00$$, b=10.0 $$,  and $$c=-200 $$ .

(b) Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2367246">
 $$ t=\frac{-b \pm  \sqrt{ b^{2}-4 a c} }{2a}. $$ 
</div>
This yields two solutions for  $$ t $$, which are

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1772100">
 $$ t=10.0 \text{ and} -20.0. $$ 
</div>
In this case, then, the time is  $$ t=t $$ in seconds, or

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2175275">
 $$ t=10.0\text{s} \text{ and}-20.0\text{s}. $$ 
</div>
A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean 
that the event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2177316">
 $$ t=10.0\text{s}. $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there will be two solutions.
In some problems both solutions are meaningful, but in others, such as the
above, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0 s answer seems reasonable for a
typical freeway on-ramp.

With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other
interesting examples and applications. In the process of developing kinematics,
we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both
correct answers and insights into physical
relationships. [Problem-Solving Basics](/contents/m42125) discusses
problem-solving basics and outlines an approach that will help you succeed in
this invaluable task.

Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Breaking News
</div>
We have been using SI units of meters per second squared to describe some 
examples of acceleration or deceleration of cars, runners, and trains.
To achieve a better feel for these numbers, one can measure the braking
deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop.
Recall that, for average acceleration,  $$ \overline{a}=\Delta v/\Delta t $$.
While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a stop
sign. Have a passenger note the initial speed in miles per hour and the time
taken (in seconds) to stop. From this, calculate the deceleration in miles per
hour per second. Convert this to meters per second squared and compare with
other decelerations mentioned in this chapter. Calculate the distance traveled
in braking.

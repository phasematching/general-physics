In the previous section, we explored the relationship between voltage and energy. In this section, we will explore the relationship between voltage and electric field. For example, a uniform electric field $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 is produced by placing a potential difference (or voltage) $\Delta V$

 across two parallel metal plates, labeled A and B. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id671952).) Examining this will tell us what voltage is needed to produce a certain electric field strength; it will also reveal a more fundamental relationship between electric potential and electric field. From a physicist’s point of view, either $\Delta V$

 or $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 can be used to describe any charge distribution. $\Delta V$

 is most closely tied to energy, whereas $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 is most closely related to force. $\Delta V$

 is a **scalar**{: data-type="term"} quantity and has no direction, while $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 is a **vector**{: data-type="term"} quantity, having both magnitude and direction. (Note that the magnitude of the electric field strength, a scalar quantity, is represented by $E$

 below.) The relationship between $\Delta V$

 and $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 is revealed by calculating the work done by the force in moving a charge from point A to point B. But, as noted in [Electric Potential Energy: Potential Difference](/m42324), this is complex for arbitrary charge distributions, requiring calculus. We therefore look at a uniform electric field as an interesting special case.

Electric field lines are parallel between the plates and curved at the ends of the plates. A charge q is moved from A to B.

The work done by the electric field in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id671952) to move a positive charge $q$

** from A, the positive plate, higher potential, to B, the negative plate, lower potential, is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-554">
$W=\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}–\Delta \text{PE}=\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}–q\Delta V.$
</div>

The potential difference between points A and B is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-694">
$–\Delta V=\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}–\left({V}_{\text{B}}–{V}_{\text{A}}\right)={V}_{\text{A}}–{V}_{\text{B}}={V}_{\text{AB}}.$
</div>

Entering this into the expression for work yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-217">
$W={\text{qV}}_{\text{AB}}.$
</div>

Work is $W=\text{Fd}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{cos}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\theta $

; here $\text{cos}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\theta =1$

, since the path is parallel to the field, and so $W=\text{Fd}$

. Since $F=\text{qE}$

, we see that $W=\text{qEd}$

. Substituting this expression for work into the previous equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-725">
$\mathrm{qEd}={\text{qV}}_{\text{AB}}.$
</div>

The charge cancels, and so the voltage between points A and B is seen to be

What Is the Highest Voltage Possible between Two Plates?
</div>
Dry air will support a maximum electric field strength of about $3.0×{\text{10}}^{6}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}$

. Above that value, the field creates enough ionization in the air to make the air a conductor. This allows a discharge or spark that reduces the field. What, then, is the maximum voltage between two parallel conducting plates separated by 2.5 cm of dry air?

**Strategy**

We are given the maximum electric field $E$

 between the plates and the distance $d$

 between them. The equation ${V}_{\text{AB}}=\mathrm{Ed}$

 can thus be used to calculate the maximum voltage.

**Solution**

The potential difference or voltage between the plates is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-785">
${\text{V}}_{\text{AB}}=\mathrm{Ed}.$
</div>
Entering the given values for $E$

 and $d$

 gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-615">
${V}_{\text{AB}}=\left(3.0×{\text{10}}^{6}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}\right)\left(0.025 m\right)=7.5×{\text{10}}^{4}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}V$
</div>
or

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-678">
${V}_{\text{AB}}=\text{75 kV}.$
</div>
(The answer is quoted to only two digits, since the maximum field strength is approximate.)

**Discussion**

One of the implications of this result is that it takes about 75 kV to make a spark jump across a 2.5 cm (1 in.) gap, or 150 kV for a 5 cm spark. This limits the voltages that can exist between conductors, perhaps on a power transmission line. A smaller voltage will cause a spark if there are points on the surface, since points create greater fields than smooth surfaces. Humid air breaks down at a lower field strength, meaning that a smaller voltage will make a spark jump through humid air. The largest voltages can be built up, say with static electricity, on dry days.

</div>

![The picture shows a spark chamber placed on a wooden base.](../resources/Figure_20_02_02a.jpg "A spark chamber is used to trace the paths of high-energy particles. Ionization created by the particles as they pass through the gas between the plates allows a spark to jump. The sparks are perpendicular to the plates, following electric field lines between them. The potential difference between adjacent plates is not high enough to cause sparks without the ionization produced by particles from accelerator experiments (or cosmic rays).

Field and Force inside an Electron Gun
</div>
(a) An electron gun has parallel plates separated by 4.00 cm and gives electrons 25.0 keV of energy. What is the electric field strength between the plates? (b) What force would this field exert on a piece of plastic with a $\text{0.500 μC}$

 charge that gets between the plates?

**Strategy** **

Since the voltage and plate separation are given, the electric field strength can be calculated directly from the expression $E=\frac{ {V}_{\text{AB}}}{d}$

. Once the electric field strength is known, the force on a charge is found using $\mathbf{\text{F}}=q\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\mathbf{\text{E}}$

. Since the electric field is in only one direction, we can write this equation in terms of the magnitudes, $F=q\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}E$

.

**Solution for (a)**

The expression for the magnitude of the electric field between two uniform metal plates is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-638">
$E=\frac{ {V}_{\text{AB}}}{d}.$
</div>
Since the electron is a single charge and is given 25.0 keV of energy, the potential difference must be 25.0 kV. Entering this value for ${V}_{\text{AB}}$

 and the plate separation of 0.0400 m, we obtain

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-734">
$E=\frac{\text{25}\text{.}\text{0 kV}}{0\text{.}\text{0400 m}}=6\text{.}\text{25}×{\text{10}}^{5}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}.$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

The magnitude of the force on a charge in an electric field is obtained from the equation

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-435">
$F=\mathrm{qE}.$
</div>
Substituting known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-0">
$F=\left(\text{0.500}×{\text{10}}^{–6}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{C}\right)\left(\text{6.25}×{\text{10}}^{5}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}\right)=\text{0.313 N}.$
</div>
**Discussion** **

Note that the units are newtons, since $\text{1 V/m}=\text{1 N/C}$

. The force on the charge is the same no matter where the charge is located between the plates. This is because the electric field is uniform between the plates.

</div>

In more general situations, regardless of whether the electric field is uniform, it points in the direction of decreasing potential, because the force on a positive charge is in the direction of $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 and also in the direction of lower potential $V$

. Furthermore, the magnitude of $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 equals the rate of decrease of $V$

 with distance. The faster $V$

 decreases over distance, the greater the electric field. In equation form, the general relationship between voltage and electric field is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-977">
$E=\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}–\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta s},$
</div>

where $\Delta s$

 is the distance over which the change in potential, $\Delta V$

, takes place. The minus sign tells us that $\mathbf{\text{E}}$

 points in the direction of decreasing potential. The electric field is said to be the **gradient** (as in grade or slope) of the electric potential.

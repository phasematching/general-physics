* Understand Newton\'s third law of motion.

There is a passage in the musical *Man of la Mancha* that relates to Newton’s
third law of motion. Sancho, in describing a fight with his wife to Don Quixote,
says, “Of course I hit her back, Your Grace, but she’s a lot harder than me and
you know what they say, ‘Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits
the stone, it’s going to be bad for the pitcher.’” This is exactly what happens
whenever one body exerts a force on another—the first also experiences a force (
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction). Numerous common experiences, such
as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, confirm this. It is precisely stated in **
Newton’s third law of motion**.

<div class="title">
Newton’s Third Law of Motion
</div>
Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.

</div>

This law represents a certain *symmetry in nature* : Forces always occur in
pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force
itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as “action-reaction,” where the
force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the
reaction. Newton’s third law has practical uses in analyzing the origin of
forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.

We can readily see Newton’s third law at work by taking a look at how people
move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as
illustrated in [Figure 1](#fig1). She pushes against the pool wall with her feet
and accelerates in the direction *opposite* to that of her push. The wall has
exerted an equal and opposite force back on the swimmer. You might think that
two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not
*because they act on different systems*. In this case, there are two systems
that we could investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we select the swimmer to
be the system of interest, as in the figure, then $$ \vb{F}_
{\text{wall on feet}} $$ is an external force on this system and affects its
motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of $$ \vb{F}_{\text{wall on feet}}
$$. In contrast, the force $$ \vb{F}_{\text{feet on wall}} $$ acts on the wall
and not on our system of interest. Thus $$ \vb{F}_{\text{feet on wall}} $$ does
not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel $$ \vb{F}_
{\text{wall on feet}} $$. Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite
to that in which she wishes to move. The reaction to her push is thus in the
desired direction.

![A swimmer is exerting a force with her feet on a wall inside a swimming pool represented by an arrow labeled as vector F sub Feet on wall, pointing toward the right, and the wall is also exerting an equal force on her feet, represented by an arrow labeled as vector F sub Wall on feet, having the same length but pointing toward the left. The direction of acceleration of the swimmer is toward the left, shown by an arrow toward the left.](../resources/Figure_04_04_01.jpg "When the swimmer exerts a force \( \vb{F}_\text{feet on wall} \) on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. This means the net external force on her is in the direction opposite to \( \vb{F}_\text{feet on wall} \) . This opposition occurs because, in accordance with Newton’s third law of motion, the wall exerts a force \( \vb{F}_\text{wall on feet} \) on her, equal in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she exerts on it. The line around the swimmer indicates the system of interest. Note that \( \vb{F}_\text{feet on wall} \) does not act on this system (the swimmer) and, thus, does not cancel \( \vb{F}_\text{wall on feet} \). Thus the free-body diagram shows only \( \vb{F}_\text{feet on wall} \), \( \vb{w} \), the gravitational force, and \( \vb{BF} \), the buoyant force of the water supporting the swimmer’s weight. The vertical forces \( \vb{w} \) and \( \vb{BF} \) cancel since there is no vertical motion.")
{: #fig1}

Other examples of Newton’s third law are easy to find. As a professor paces in
front of a whiteboard, she exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor
exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that causes her to accelerate
forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the
drive wheels in reaction to the drive wheels pushing backward on the ground. You
can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road
and throw rocks backward. In another example, rockets move forward by expelling
gas backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward
force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas therefore exerts
a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force is called
**thrust**. It is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by
pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a
vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases. Helicopters
similarly create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an upward
reaction force. Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on air in a
direction opposite to that of whatever force they need. For example, the wings
of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward.
An octopus propels itself in the water by ejecting water through a funnel from
its body, similar to a jet ski. In a situation similar to Sancho’s, professional
cage fighters experience reaction forces when they punch, sometimes breaking
their hand by hitting an opponent’s body.

Getting Up To Speed: Choosing the Correct System
</div>
A physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a lecture hall, as seen in [Figure 2](#fig2). Her mass is 65.0 kg, the cart’s is 12.0 kg, and the equipment’s is 7.0 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced when the professor exerts a backward force of 150 N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the cart’s wheels and air resistance, total 24.0 N.

![A professor is pushing a cart of demonstration equipment. Two systems are labeled in the figure. System one includes both the professor and cart, and system two only has the cart. She is exerting some force F sub prof toward the right, shown by a vector arrow, and the cart is also pushing her with the same magnitude of force directed toward the left, shown by a vector F sub cart, having same length as F sub prof. The friction force small f is shown by a vector arrow pointing left acting between the wheels of the cart and the floor. The professor is pushing the floor with her feet with a force F sub foot toward the left, shown by a vector arrow. The floor is pushing her feet with a force that has the same magnitude, F sub floor, shown by a vector arrow pointing right that has the same length as the vector F sub foot. A free-body diagram is also shown. For system one, friction force acting toward the left is shown by a vector arrow having a small length, and the force F sub floor is acting toward the right, shown by a vector arrow larger than the length of vector f. In system two, friction force represented by a short vector small f acts toward the left and another vector F sub prof is represented by a vector arrow toward the right. F sub prof is longer than small f.](../resources/Figure_04_04_02.jpg "A professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment. The lengths of the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes of the forces (except for \( \vb{f} \) , since it is too small to draw to scale). Different questions are asked in each example; thus, the system of interest must be defined differently for each. System 1 is appropriate for this example, since it asks for the acceleration of the entire group of objects. Only \( \vb{F}_{\text{floor}} \) and \( \vb{f} \) are external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other forces either cancel or act on the outside world. System 2 is chosen for [link] so that \( \vb{F}_{\text{prof}} \) will be an external force and enter into Newton&#x2019;s second law. Note that the free-body diagrams, which allow us to apply Newton&#x2019;s second law, vary with the system chosen. ")
{: #fig2}

**Strategy**

Since they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the professor, cart,
and equipment. This is System 1 in [Figure 2](#fig2). The professor pushes
backward with a force $$ \vb{F}_{\text{foot}} $$ of 150 N. According to Newton’s
third law, the floor exerts a forward reaction force $$ \vb{F}_{\text{floor}} $$
of 150 N on System 1. Because all motion is horizontal, we can assume there is
no net force in the vertical direction. The problem is therefore one-dimensional
along the horizontal direction. As noted, $$ \vb{f} $$ opposes the motion and is
thus in the opposite direction of $$ \vb{F}_{\text{floor}} $$. Note that we do
not include the forces $$ \vb{F}_{\text{prof}} $$ or $$ \vb{F}_{\text{cart}} $$
because these are internal forces, and we do not include $$ \vb{F}_{\text{foot}}
$$ because it acts on the floor, not on the system. There are no other
significant forces acting on System 1. If the net external force can be found
from all this information, we can use Newton’s second law to find the
acceleration as requested. See the free-body diagram in the figure.

**Solution**

Newton’s second law is given by

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{ F_{\text{net}}}{m}. $$
</div>
The net external force on System 1 is deduced from [Figure 2](#fig2)
and the discussion above to be

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=F_{\text{floor}}-f=150 \N -24.0 \N =126 \N . $$
</div>
The mass of System 1 is

<div class="equation">
 $$ m=\left(65.0+12.0+7.0\right)\kg =84 \kg . $$
</div>
These values of $$ F_{\text{net}} $$ and $$ m $$ produce an acceleration of

<div class="equation">
 $$ \begin{array}{lll}
a&=&\frac{ F_{\text{net}}}{m},\\
a&=&\frac{126 \N }{84 \kg }=1.5 \mss .
\end{array} $$
</div>

**Discussion**

None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the
professor’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because
they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is to note that
forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude
and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the professor on
the cart results in an equal and opposite force back on her. In this case both
forces act on the same system and, therefore, cancel. Thus internal forces (
between components of a system) cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving
this problem.

<div class="title">
Force on the Cart—Choosing a New System
</div>
Calculate the force the professor exerts on the cart in [Figure 2](#fig2)
using data from the previous example if needed.

**Strategy**

If we now define the system of interest to be the cart plus equipment (System 2
in [Figure 2](#fig2)), then the net external force on System 2 is the force the
professor exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the cart,
$$ \vb{F}_{\text{prof}} $$, is an external force acting on System 2. $$ \vb{F}_
{\text{prof}} $$ was internal to System 1, but it is external to System 2 and
will enter Newton’s second law for System 2.

**Solution**

Newton’s second law can be used to find $$ \vb{F}_{\text{prof}} $$. Starting
with

<div class="equation">
 $$ a=\frac{ F_{\text{net}}}{m} $$
</div>
and noting that the magnitude of the net external force on System 2 is

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=F_{\text{prof}}-f, $$
</div>
we solve for $$ F_{\text{prof}} $$, the desired quantity:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{prof}}=F_{\text{net}}+f. $$
</div>
The value of $$ f $$ is given, so we must calculate net $$ F_{\text{net}} $$. That can be done
since both the acceleration and mass of System 2 are known. Using Newton’s
second law we see that

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=ma , $$
</div>
where the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg ( $$ m $$ = 12.0 kg + 7.0 kg) and its acceleration was found to be $$
a=1.5\mss $$ in the previous example. Thus,

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=ma , $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{net}}=\left(19.0 \kg \right)\left(1.5\mss \right)=29 \N . $$
</div>
Now we can find the desired force:

<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{prof}}=F_{\text{net}}+f, $$
</div>
<div class="equation">
$$ F_{\text{prof}}=29 \N +24.0 \N =53 \N . $$
</div>

**Discussion**

It is interesting that this force is significantly less than the 150-N force the
professor exerted backward on the floor. Not all of that 150-N force is
transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor.

The choice of a system is an important analytical step both in solving problems
and in thoroughly understanding the physics of the situation (which is not
necessarily the same thing).

### Section Summary

* **Newton’s third law of motion** represents a basic symmetry in nature. It
  states: Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body
  experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
  the force that the first body exerts.
* A **thrust** is a reaction force that pushes a body forward in response to a
  backward force. Rockets, airplanes, and cars are pushed forward by a thrust
  reaction force.

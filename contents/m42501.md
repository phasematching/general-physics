* Discuss the wave character of light.

We know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes
respond. Like all other electromagnetic waves, it obeys the equation

<div class="equation" >
 $$c=f\lambda \text{,} $$
</div>

where $$c=3 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $$f $$
is the frequency of the electromagnetic waves, and $$\lambda $$ is its
wavelength. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to 760 nm. As
is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when
it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However,
when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics
prominently. Interference is the hallmark of a wave, and
in [[Figure 1]](#Figure1) both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be
seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory epitomizes a ray, traveling in a
straight line. However, passing a pure-wavelength beam through vertical slits
with a size close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of
light, as the beam spreads out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark
regions caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. Rather
than spreading out, a ray would continue traveling straight ahead after passing
through slits.

Making Connections: Waves
</div>
The most certain indication of a wave is interference. This wave characteristic is most prominent when the wave interacts with an object that is not large compared with the wavelength. Interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, light waves, and (as we will see in [Special Relativity](/m42525)) for matter waves, such as electrons scattered from a crystal.

Light has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When
light goes from a vacuum to some medium, like water, its speed and wavelength
change, but its frequency $$f $$ remains the same. (We can think of light as a
forced oscillation that must have the frequency of the original source.) The
speed of light in a medium is $$v=c/n $$ , where $$n $$ is its index of
refraction. If we divide both sides of equation $$c=f\lambda $$ by $$n $$ , we
get $$c/n=v=f\lambda /n $$ . This implies that $$v=f{\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ ,
where $${\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ is the **wavelength in a medium** and that

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=\frac{\lambda }{n}\text{,} $$
</div>

where $$\lambda $$ is the wavelength in vacuum and $$n $$ is the mediumâ€™s index
of refraction. Therefore, the wavelength of light is smaller in any medium than
it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has $$n=1.333 $$ , the range of
visible wavelengths is $$\left(380 \text{nm}\right)/1.333 $$ to $$\left(760
\text{nm}\right)/1.333 $$ , or $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=285 \text{to} 570
\text{nm} $$ . Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to
another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency.

### Section Summary

* Wave optics is the branch of optics that must be used when light interacts
  with small objects or whenever the wave characteristics of light are
  considered.
* Wave characteristics are those associated with interference and diffraction.
* Visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes respond
  and has a wavelength in the range of 380 to 760 nm.
* Like all EM waves, the following relationship is valid in vacuum:
  $$c=f\lambda $$ , where $$c=3 \times 10^{8} \text{m/s} $$ is the speed of
  light, $$f $$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, and $$\lambda $$
  is its wavelength in vacuum.
* The wavelength $${\lambda }_{\text{n}} $$ of light in a medium with index of
  refraction $$n $$ is $${\lambda }_{\text{n}}=\lambda /n $$ . Its frequency is
  the same as in vacuum.

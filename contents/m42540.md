![A man with oar in his hand is kayaking downstream in a shallow fast-flowing river.](../resources/Figure_29_04_01a.jpg "The total velocity of a kayak, like this one on the Deerfield River in Massachusetts, is its velocity relative to the water as well as the water&#x2019;s velocity relative to the riverbank. (credit: abkfenris, Flickr)")


If you’ve ever seen a kayak move down a fast-moving river, you know that
remaining in the same place would be hard. The river current pulls the kayak
along. Pushing the oars back against the water can move the kayak forward in the
water, but that only accounts for part of the velocity. The kayak’s motion is an
example of classical addition of velocities. In classical physics, velocities
add as vectors. The kayak’s velocity is the vector sum of its velocity relative
to the water and the water’s velocity relative to the riverbank.

### Classical Velocity Addition

For simplicity, we restrict our consideration of velocity addition to
one-dimensional motion. Classically, velocities add like regular numbers in
one-dimensional motion. (See [[link]](#fs-id1664936).) Suppose, for example, a
girl is riding in a sled at a speed 1.0 m/s relative to an observer. She throws
a snowball first forward, then backward at a speed of 1.5 m/s relative to the
sled. We denote direction with plus and minus signs in one dimension; in this
example, forward is positive. Let $$v $$ be the velocity of the sled relative to
the Earth, $$u $$ the velocity of the snowball relative to the Earth-bound
observer, and $$u^{\prime} $$ the velocity of the snowball relative to the sled.

![In part a, a man is pulling a sled towards the right with a velocity v equals one point zero meters per second. A girl sitting on the sled facing forward throws a snowball toward a boy on the far right of the picture. The snowball is labeled u primed equals one point five meters per second in the direction the sled is being pulled. The boy is labelled two point five meters per second. In figure b, a similar figure is shown, but the man&#x2019;s velocity is one point zero meters per second, the girl is facing backward and throwing the snowball behind the sled. The snowball is labelled u primed equals negative one point five meters per second, and the boy is labelled u equals negative zero point five meters per second.](../resources/Figure_29_04_02a.jpg "Classically, velocities add like ordinary numbers in one-dimensional motion. Here the girl throws a snowball forward and then backward from a sled. The velocity of the sled relative to the Earth is \( v=1.0 \text{m/s} \) . The velocity of the snowball relative to the truck is \( u^\prime \) , while its velocity relative to the Earth is \( u \) . Classically, \( u=v+u\prime \) .")


<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="">
<div class="title">
Classical Velocity Addition
</div>
<div class="equation" >
 $$u=v+u^\prime  $$
</div>
</div>

Thus, when the girl throws the snowball forward, $$u=1.0 \text{m/s}+1.5
\text{m/s}=2.5 \text{m/s} $$ . It makes good intuitive sense that the snowball
will head towards the Earth-bound observer faster, because it is thrown forward
from a moving vehicle. When the girl throws the snowball backward, $$u=1.0
\text{m/s}+\left(-1.5 \text{m/s}\right)=-0.5 \text{m/s} $$ . The minus sign
means the snowball moves away from the Earth-bound observer.

### Relativistic Velocity Addition

The second postulate of relativity (verified by extensive experimental
observation) says that classical velocity addition does not apply to light.
Imagine a car traveling at night along a straight road, as
in [[link]](#fs-id2834724). If classical velocity addition applied to light,
then the light from the car’s headlights would approach the observer on the
sidewalk at a speed $$u=v+c $$ . But we know that light will move away from the
car at speed $$c $$ relative to the driver of the car, and light will move
towards the observer on the sidewalk at speed $$c $$ , too.

![A car is moving towards right with velocity v. A boy standing on the side-walk observes the car. The velocity of light u primed is shown to be c as observed by the girl in the car and the velocity of light u is also c as observed by the boy.](../resources/Figure_29_04_03a.jpg "According to experiment and the second postulate of relativity, light from the car&#x2019;s headlights moves away from the car at speed \( c \) and towards the observer on the sidewalk at speed \( c \) . Classical velocity addition is not valid.")

Relativistic Velocity Addition
</div>
Either light is an exception, or the classical velocity addition formula only works at low velocities. The latter is the case. The correct formula for one-dimensional **relativistic velocity addition** is

<div class="equation" >
 $$u=\frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime }{1+\frac{v u^{\prime} }{ {c}^{2}}}, $$
</div>
where  $$v $$
 is the relative velocity between two observers,  $$u $$
 is the velocity of an object relative to one observer, and  $$u^{\prime} $$
 is the velocity relative to the other observer. (For ease of visualization, we often choose to measure  $$u $$
 in our reference frame, while someone moving at  $$v $$
 relative to us measures  $$u^{\prime} $$ .)
 Note that the term  $$\frac{vu^{\prime}}{ {c}^{2}} $$
 becomes very small at low velocities, and  $$u=\frac{ v+u^\prime }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{ {c}^{2}}} $$
 gives a result very close to classical velocity addition. As before, we see that classical velocity addition is an excellent approximation to the correct relativistic formula for small velocities. No wonder that it seems correct in our experience.

Showing that the Speed of Light towards an Observer is Constant (in a Vacuum): The Speed of Light is the Speed of Light
</div>
Suppose a spaceship heading directly towards the Earth at half the speed of light sends a signal to us on a laser-produced beam of light. Given that the light leaves the ship at speed  $$c $$
 as observed from the ship, calculate the speed at which it approaches the Earth.

![A spacecraft is heading towards earth v equals zero point five zero zero times c. A laser beam from the ship travels towards the Earth with velocity c as shown by a vector. A second spaceship traveling away from the Earth. The velocity of the second ship and second laser are the same as the first, but in the opposite direction.](../resources/Figure_29_04_04a.jpg)


**Strategy**

Because the light and the spaceship are moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot
use simple velocity addition. Instead, we can determine the speed at which the
light approaches the Earth using relativistic velocity addition.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns. $$v= 0.500c $$ ; $$u^{\prime}=c $$
2. Identify the unknown. $$u $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$u=\frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime
   }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{ {c}^{2}}} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\begin{array}{lll}u& =& \frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{
   {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{0.500c+c}{1+\frac{\left(0.500c\right)\left(c\right)}{
   {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{\left(0.500+1\right)c}{1+\frac{0.500{c}^{2}}{
   {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{1.500c}{1+0.500}\\ & =& \frac{1.500c}{1.500}\\ & =&
   c\end{array} $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

Relativistic velocity addition gives the correct result. Light leaves the ship
at speed $$c $$ and approaches the Earth at speed $$c $$ . The speed of light is
independent of the relative motion of source and observer, whether the observer
is on the ship or Earth-bound.

</div>

Velocities cannot add to greater than the speed of light, provided that $$v $$
is less than $$c $$ and $$u^{\prime} $$ does not exceed $$c $$ . The following
example illustrates that relativistic velocity addition is not as symmetric as
classical velocity addition.

Comparing the Speed of Light towards and away from an Observer: Relativistic Package Delivery
</div>
Suppose the spaceship in the previous example is approaching the Earth at half the speed of light and shoots a canister at a speed of  $$0.750c $$ .
 (a) At what velocity will an Earth-bound observer see the canister if it is shot directly towards the Earth? (b) If it is shot directly away from the Earth? (See [[link]](#fs-id893371).)

![In part a, a spaceship is moving towards the earth from left to right with a velocity v equals to zero point five zero times c. The spaceships shoots a canister towards earth with velocity u prime equals zero point seven five times c. A man stands stationary on earth observing. In part b, the spaceship shoots the canister away from earth with same velocity. In both the cases, the velocity of the ship is v equals 0 point five zero times c toward left.](../resources/Figure_29_04_05a.jpg)


**Strategy**

Because the canister and the spaceship are moving at relativistic speeds, we
must determine the speed of the canister by an Earth-bound observer using
relativistic velocity addition instead of simple velocity addition.

**Solution for (a)**

1. Identify the knowns. $$v=0.500c $$ ; $$u^{\prime}= 0.750c $$
2. Identify the unknown. $$u $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$u=\frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime
   }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{ {c}^{2}}} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\begin{array}{ll}u& =& \frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{
   {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{0.500\text{c +}0.750c}{1+\frac{\left(0.500c\right)
   \left(0.750c\right)}{ {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{1.250c}{1+0.375}\\ & =&
   0.909c\end{array} $$
   </div>

**Solution for (b)**

1. Identify the knowns. $$\text{v}=0.500c $$ ; $$u^{\prime}=-0.750c $$
2. Identify the unknown. $$u $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $$\text{u}=\frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime
   }{1+\frac{v u^{\prime} }{ {c}^{2}}} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\begin{array}{ll}u& =& \frac{\mathrm{v+u}\prime }{1+\frac{vu^{\prime}}{
   {c}^{2}}}\\ & =& \frac{0.500\mathrm{c +}\left(-0.750c\right)}{1+\frac{\left(
   0.500c\right)\left(-0.750c\right)}{ {c}^{2}}}\\ & =&
   \frac{-0.250c}{1-0.375}\\ & =& -0.400c\end{array} $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

The minus sign indicates velocity away from the Earth (in the opposite direction
from $$v $$ ), which means the canister is heading towards the Earth in part (a)
and away in part (b), as expected. But relativistic velocities do not add as
simply as they do classically. In part (a), the canister does approach the Earth
faster, but not at the simple sum of $$1.250c $$ . The total velocity is less
than you would get classically. And in part (b), the canister moves away from
the Earth at a velocity of $$-0.400c $$ , which is **faster** than the $$-0.250c
$$ you would expect classically. The velocities are not even symmetric. In
part (a) the canister moves $$0.409c $$ faster than the ship relative to the
Earth, whereas in part (b) it moves $$0.900c $$ slower than the ship.

### Doppler Shift

Although the speed of light does not change with relative velocity, the
frequencies and wavelengths of light do. First discussed for sound waves, a
Doppler shift occurs in any wave when there is relative motion between source
and observer.

<div class="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div class="title">
Relativistic Doppler Effects
</div>
The observed wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is longer (called a red shift) than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and shorter (called a blue shift) when the source moves towards the observer.

<div class="equation" >
 $${\lambda}_{\text{obs}}=\lambda_{s} \sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{u}{c}}{1-\frac{u}{c}}}. $$
</div>
</div>

In the Doppler equation, $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}} $$ is the observed
wavelength, $${\lambda }_{s} $$ is the source wavelength, and $$u $$ is the
relative velocity of the source to the observer. The velocity $$u $$ is positive
for motion away from an observer and negative for motion toward an observer. In
terms of source frequency and observed frequency, this equation can be written

<div class="equation" >
 $${f}_{\text{obs}}=f_{s}\sqrt{\frac{1-\frac{u}{c}}{1+\frac{u}{c}}}. $$
</div>

Notice that the – and + signs are different than in the wavelength equation.

Career Connection: Astronomer
</div>
If you are interested in a career that requires a knowledge of special relativity, there’s probably no better connection than astronomy. Astronomers must take into account relativistic effects when they calculate distances, times, and speeds of black holes, galaxies, quasars, and all other astronomical objects. To have a career in astronomy, you need at least an undergraduate degree in either physics or astronomy, but a Master’s or doctoral degree is often required. You also need a good background in high-level mathematics.

Calculating a Doppler Shift: Radio Waves from a Receding Galaxy
</div>
Suppose a galaxy is moving away from the Earth at a speed  $$0.825c $$ . It emits radio waves with a wavelength of  $$ 0.525 \text{m} $$ .
 What wavelength would we detect on the Earth?

**Strategy**

Because the galaxy is moving at a relativistic speed, we must determine the
Doppler shift of the radio waves using the relativistic Doppler shift instead of
the classical Doppler shift.

**Solution**

1. Identify the knowns. $$u= 0.825c $$ ; $${\lambda }_{s}= 0.525 \text{m} $$
2. Identify the unknown. $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}} $$
3. Choose the appropriate equation. $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}=\lambda_
   {s}\sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{u}{c}}{1-\frac{u}{c}}} $$
4. Plug the knowns into the equation.
   <div class="equation" >
   $$\begin{array}{lll}{\lambda }_{\text{obs}}& =& {\text{λ}}_
   {s}\sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{u}{c}}{1-\frac{u}{c}}}\\ & =& \left(0.525 m\right)
   \sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{ 0.825\text{c}}{c}}{1-\frac{ 0.825\text{c}}{c}}}\\ & =&
   1.70 \text{m} \text{.} \end{array} $$
   </div>

**Discussion**

Because the galaxy is moving away from the Earth, we expect the wavelengths of
radiation it emits to be redshifted. The wavelength we calculated is 1.70 m,
which is redshifted from the original wavelength of 0.525 m.

</div>

The relativistic Doppler shift is easy to observe. This equation has everyday
applications ranging from Doppler-shifted radar velocity measurements of
transportation to Doppler-radar storm monitoring. In astronomical observations,
the relativistic Doppler shift provides velocity information such as the motion
and distance of stars.

### Section Summary

* With classical velocity addition, velocities add like regular numbers in
  one-dimensional motion:
  $$u=v+u^\prime $$ , where $$v $$ is the velocity between two observers, $$u $$
  is the velocity of an object relative to one observer, and $$u^{\prime} $$ is
  the velocity relative to the other observer.
* Velocities cannot add to be greater than the speed of light. Relativistic
  velocity addition describes the velocities of an object moving at a
  relativistic speed:

  <div class="equation" >
   $$u=\frac{v+u^\prime }{1+\frac{v u^{\prime} }{ {c}^{2}}} $$
  </div>

* An observer of electromagnetic radiation sees **relativistic Doppler effects**
  {: class="term"} if the source of the radiation is moving relative to the
  observer. The wavelength of the radiation is longer (called a red shift) than
  that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and
  shorter (called a blue shift) when the source moves toward the observer. The
  shifted wavelength is described by the equation
  <div class="equation" >
   $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}}=\lambda_{s}_{s}\sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{u}{c}}{1-\frac{u}{c}}} $$
  </div>

  $${\lambda }_{\text{obs}} $$ is the observed wavelength, $${\lambda }_{s} $$
  is the source wavelength, and $$u $$ is the relative velocity of the source to
  the observer.

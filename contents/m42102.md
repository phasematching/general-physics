Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For example, we
can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and
listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying the kinematics developed
so far to falling objects, we can examine some interesting situations and learn
much about gravity in the process.

### Gravity

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that, if air
resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects
fall toward the center of Earth with the *same constant acceleration*, *
independent of their mass*. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected,
because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that
we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones.

![Positions of a feather and hammer over time as they fall on the Moon. The feather and hammer are at the exact same position at each moment in time.](../resources/Figure_02_07_00a.jpg "A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s2 size 12{1 &quot;.&quot; &quot;67 m/s&quot; rSup { size 8{2} } } {}. &#10;      ")
{: #import-auto-id4126662}

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than
a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach the ground after a
hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the
difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an
object through the air, while friction between objects—such as between clothes
and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also
opposes motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few
chapters, an object *falling without air resistance or friction* is defined to
be in **free-fall**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1714641}.

The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The
acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the **acceleration due
to gravity**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1707599}. The acceleration due to
gravity is *constant*, which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any
falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens a
broad class of interesting situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is
so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol, \\( g \\)

. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-636">
 \\( g=9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2}\text{.} \\) 
</div>

Although \\( g \\)

varies from \\( 9\text{.}{\text{78 m/s}}^{2} \\)

to \\(  \\)

\\( 9\text{.}{\text{83 m/s}}^{2} \\)

, depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local
topography, the average value of \\(
9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

will be used in this text unless otherwise specified. The direction of the
acceleration due to gravity is *downward (
towards the center of Earth)*. In fact, its direction *defines* what we call
vertical. Note that whether the acceleration \\( a \\)

in the kinematic equations has the value \\( +g \\)

or \\( -g \\)

depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward
direction as positive, then \\(
a=-g=-9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

, and if we define the downward direction as positive, then \\(
a=g=9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

.

### One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity

The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start
with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So we
start by considering straight up and down motion with no air resistance or
friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if there is any) is
vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero. Once
the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in
free-fall. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has
constant acceleration of magnitude \\( g \\)

. We will also represent vertical displacement with the symbol \\( y \\)

and use \\( x \\)

for horizontal displacement.

Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Upward
</div>
A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s*.* The rock misses the edge of the cliff as it falls back to earth. Calculate the position and velocity of the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the effects of air resistance.

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![Velocity vector arrow pointing up in the positive y direction, labeled v sub 0 equals thirteen point 0 meters per second. Acceleration vector arrow pointing down in the negative y direction, labeled a equals negative 9 point 8 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_07_00b.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id2188586}

We are asked to determine the position \\( y \\)

at various times. It is reasonable to take the initial position \\( {y}_{0} \\)

to be zero. This problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical
direction. We use plus and minus signs to indicate direction, with up being
positive and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward,
the initial velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to gravity is
downward, so \\( a \\)

is negative. It is crucial that the initial velocity and the acceleration due to
gravity have opposite signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due
to gravity opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.

Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times, we will
refer to these as \\( {y}_{1} \\)

and \\( {v}_{1} \\)

; * \\( {y}_{2} \\)

* and \\( {v}_{2} \\)

; and \\( {y}_{3} \\)

and \\( {v}_{3} \\)

.

<strong>Solution for Position </strong>  \\( {y}_{1} \\)

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that \\( {y}_{0}=0 \\)

; \\( {v}_{0}=\text{13}\text{.}\text{0 m/s} \\)

; \\( a=-g=-9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

; and \\( t=1\text{.}\text{00 s} \\)

.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. We will use \\( y={y}_{0}+{v}_
{0}t+\frac{1}{2}{\text{at}}^{2} \\)

because it includes only one unknown, \\( y \\)

(or \\( {y}_{1} \\)

, here),** which is the value we want to find.

3\. Plug in the known values and solve for \\( {y}_{1} \\)

.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2302522">
 \\( y{}_{1}\text{}=0+\left(\text{13}\text{.}\text{0 m/s}\right)\left(1\text{.}\text{00 s}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(-9\text{.}\text{80}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}{\text{m/s}}^{2}\right){\left(1\text{.}\text{00 s}\right)}^{2}=8\text{.}\text{10}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{m} \\) 
</div>
**Discussion**

The rock is 8.10 m above its starting point at \\( t=1\text{.}\text{00} \\)

s, since \\( {y}_{1}>{y}_{0} \\)

. It could be *moving* up or down; the only way to tell is to calculate \\( {v}_
{1} \\)

and find out if it is positive or negative.

<strong>Solution for Velocity </strong>  \\( {v}_{1} \\)

1\. Identify the knowns. We know that \\( {y}_{0}=0 \\)

; \\( {v}_{0}=\text{13}\text{.}\text{0 m/s} \\)

; \\( a=-g=-9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

; and \\( t=1\text{.}\text{00 s} \\)

. We also know from the solution above that \\( {y}_{1}=8\text{.}\text{10 m} \\)

.

2\. Identify the best equation to use. The most straightforward is \\( v={v}_
{0}-\text{gt} \\)

(from \\( v={v}_{0}+\text{at} \\)

, where \\( a=\text{gravitational acceleration}=-g \\)

).

3\. Plug in the knowns and solve.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1688803">
 \\( {v}_{1}={v}_{0}-\text{gt}=\text{13}\text{.}\text{0 m/s}-\left(9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2}\right)\left(1\text{.}\text{00 s}\right)=3\text{.}\text{20 m/s} \\) 
</div>
**Discussion**

The positive value for \\( {v}_{1} \\)

means that the rock is still heading upward at \\(
t=1\text{.}\text{00}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{s} \\)

. However, it has slowed from its original 13.0** m/s, as expected.

**Solution for Remaining Times**

The procedures for calculating the position and velocity at \\(
t=2\text{.}\text{00}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{s} \\)

and \\( 3\text{.}\text{00 s} \\)

are the same as those above. The results are summarized in [\[link\]](#eip-304)
and illustrated in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id4064055).

Graphing the data helps us understand it more clearly.

![Three panels showing three graphs. The top panel shows a graph of vertical position in meters versus time in seconds. The line begins at the origin and has a positive slope that decreases over time until it hits a turning point between seconds 1 and 2. After that it has a negative slope that increases over time. The middle panel shows a graph of velocity in meters per second versus time in seconds. The line is straight, with a negative slope, beginning at time zero velocity of thirteen meters per second and ending at time 3 seconds with a velocity just over negative sixteen meters per second. The bottom panel shows a graph of acceleration in meters per second squared versus time in seconds.

{: #import-auto-id4064055}

**Discussion**

The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is above
its starting point and heading upward, since \\( {y}_{1} \\)

and \\( {v}_{1} \\)

are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its starting point, but
the negative velocity means it is moving downward. At 3.00 s, both \\( {y}_{3}
\\)

and \\( {v}_{3} \\)

are negative, meaning the rock is below its starting point and continuing to
move downward. Notice that when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.5 s), its
velocity is zero, but its acceleration is still \\( -9\text{.}{\text{80
m/s}}^{2} \\)

. Its acceleration is \\( -9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

<sup /> for the whole trip—while it is moving up and while it is moving down. Note that the values for  \\( y \\) 

** are the positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances
traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well as
downward. Both have the same acceleration—the acceleration due to gravity, which
remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in the famous Vomit Comet,
for example, experience free-fall while arcing up as well as down, as we will
discuss in more detail later.

Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Reaction Time

A simple experiment can be done to determine your reaction time. Have a friend hold a ruler between your thumb and index finger, separated by about 1 cm. Note the mark on the ruler that is right between your fingers. Have your friend drop the ruler unexpectedly, and try to catch it between your two fingers. Note the new reading on the ruler. Assuming acceleration is that due to gravity, calculate your reaction time. How far would you travel in a car (moving at 30 m/s) if the time it took your foot to go from the gas pedal to the brake was twice this reaction time?

Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down
</div>
What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down, instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been thrown downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s.

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![Velocity vector arrow pointing down in the negative y direction and labeled v sub zero equals negative thirteen point 0 meters per second. Acceleration vector arrow also pointing down in the negative y direction, labeled a equals negative 9 point 80 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_06_01a.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id2150750}

Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative because it
finishes below the starting point at \\( {y}_{0}=0 \\)

. Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as is the
acceleration due to gravity. We expect the final velocity to be negative since
the rock will continue to move downward.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. \\( {y}_{0}=0 \\)

; \\( {y}_{1}=-5\text{.}\text{10 m} \\)

; \\( {v}_{0}=-\text{13}\text{.0 m/s} \\)

; \\( a=-g=-9\text{.}\text{80 m}{\text{/s}}^{2} \\)

.

2\. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the problem.
The equation \\( {v}^{2}={v}_
{0}^{2}+2a\left(y-{y}_{0}\right) \\)

works well because the only unknown in it is \\( v \\)

. (We will plug \\( {y}_{1} \\)

in for \\( y \\)

.)

3\. Enter the known values

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2025017">
 \\( {v}^{2}={\left(-\text{13}\text{.}\text{0 m/s}\right)}^{2}+2\left(-9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2}\right)\left(-5\text{.}\text{10 m}-\text{0 m}\right)=\text{268}\text{.}{\text{96 m}}^{2}{\text{/s}}^{2}, \\) 
</div>
where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an intermediate result.

Taking the square root, and noting that a square root can be positive or
negative, gives

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1763704">
 \\( v=±\text{16}\text{.4 m/s}. \\) 
</div>
The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading down. Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2563747">
 \\( v=-\text{16}\text{.4 m/s}. \\) 
</div>
**Discussion**

Note that *this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this position when
it was thrown straight upward with the same initial speed*. (
See [\[link\]](#fs-id4067058) and [\[link\]](#import-auto-id4173440)(a).) This
is not a coincidental result. Because we only consider the acceleration due to
gravity in this problem, the *speed* of a falling object depends only on its
initial speed and its vertical position relative to the starting point. For
example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a height of 8.10 m above
the starting point (using the method from [\[link\]](#fs-id4067058)) when the
initial velocity is 13.0 m/s straight up, a result of \\( ±3\text{.}\text{20
m/s} \\)

is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs when the
rock is at 8.10 m and heading up, and the negative value occurs when the rock is
at 8.10 m and heading back down. It has the same *speed* but the opposite
direction.

![Two figures are shown. At left, a man standing on the edge of a cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial speed of thirteen meters per second. At right, the man throws the rock straight down with a speed of thirteen meters per second. In both figures, a line indicates the rock&#x2019;s trajectory. When the rock is thrown straight up, it has a speed of minus sixteen point four meters per second at minus five point one zero meters below the point where the man released the rock. When the rock is thrown straight down, the velocity is the same at this position.](../resources/Figure_02_06_00b.jpg "(a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in [link]. The arrows are velocity vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 s. (b) A person throws a rock straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in [link]. Note that at the same distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in both cases. ")
{: #import-auto-id4173440}

Another way to look at it is this: In [\[link\]](#fs-id4067058), the rock is
thrown up with an initial velocity of \\(
\text{13}\text{.0 m/s} \\)

. It rises and then falls back down. When its position is \\( y=0 \\)

on its way back down, its velocity is \\( -\text{13}\text{.0 m/s} \\)

. That is, it has the same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then
expect its velocity at a position of \\( y=-5\text{.}\text{10 m} \\)

to be the same whether we have thrown it upwards at \\( +\text{13}\text{.0 m/s}
\\)

or thrown it downwards at \\( -\text{13}\text{.0 m/s} \\)

. The velocity of the rock on its way down from \\( y=0 \\)

is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start with, as long as the
speed with which it was initially thrown is the same.

Find *g* from Data on a Falling Object
</div>
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example, [\[link\]](#import-auto-id4097254). Very precise results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed time.

![Figure has four panels. The first panel (on the top) is an illustration of a ball falling toward the ground at intervals of one tenth of a second. The space between the vertical position of the ball at one time step and the next increases with each time step. At time equals 0, position and velocity are also 0. At time equals 0 point 1 seconds, y position equals negative 0 point 049 meters and velocity is negative 0 point 98 meters per second. At 0 point 5 seconds, y position is negative 1 point 225 meters and velocity is negative 4 point 90 meters per second. The second panel (in the middle) is a line graph of position in meters versus time in seconds. Line begins at the origin and slopes down with increasingly negative slope. The third panel (bottom left) is a line graph of velocity in meters per second versus time in seconds. Line is straight, beginning at the origin and with a constant negative slope. The fourth panel (bottom right) is a line graph of acceleration in meters per second squared versus time in seconds. Line is flat, at a constant y value of negative 9 point 80 meters per second squared.](../resources/Figure_02_06_02.jpg "Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly with time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a constant and is equal to gravitational acceleration.")
{: #import-auto-id4097254}

Suppose the ball falls 1.0000 m in 0.45173 s. Assuming the ball is not affected
by air resistance, what is the precise acceleration due to gravity at this
location?

**Strategy**

Draw a sketch.

![The figure shows a green dot labeled v sub zero equals zero meters per second, a purple downward pointing arrow labeled a equals question mark, and an x y coordinate system with the y axis pointing vertically up and the x axis pointing horizontally to the right.](../resources/Figure_02_06_02b.jpg)
{: #import-auto-id4051158}

We need to solve for acceleration \\( a \\)

. Note that in this case, displacement is downward and therefore negative, as is
acceleration.

**Solution**

1\. Identify the knowns. \\( {y}_{0}=0 \\)

; \\( y=–1\text{.0000 m} \\)

; \\( t=0\text{.45173} \\)

; \\( {v}_{0}=0 \\)

.

2\. Choose the equation that allows you to solve for \\( a \\)

using the known values.

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id3578358">
 \\( y={y}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}{\text{at}}^{2} \\) 
</div>
3\. Substitute 0 for  \\( {v}_{0} \\) 

and rearrange the equation to solve for \\( a \\)

. Substituting 0 for \\( {v}_{0} \\)

yields

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id3538274">
 \\( y={y}_{0}+\frac{1}{2}{\text{at}}^{2}\text{.} \\) 
</div>
Solving for  \\( a \\) 

gives

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id3504484">
 \\( a=\frac{2\left(y-{y}_{0}\right)}{ {t}^{2}}\text{.} \\) 
</div>
4\. Substitute known values yields

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id2571438">
 \\( a=\frac{2\left(-1\text{.}\text{0000 m – 0}\right)}{\left(0\text{.}\text{45173 s}{\right)}^{2}}=-9\text{.}{\text{8010 m/s}}^{2}, \\) 
</div>
so, because  \\( a=-g \\) 

with the directions we have chosen,

<div data-type="equation" id="import-auto-id1706716">
 \\( g=9\text{.}{\text{8010 m/s}}^{2}. \\) 
</div>
**Discussion**

The negative value for \\( a \\)

indicates that the gravitational acceleration is downward, as expected. We
expect the value to be somewhere around the average value of \\(
9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

, so \\( 9\text{.}{\text{8010 m/s}}^{2} \\)

makes sense. Since the data going into the calculation are relatively precise,
this value for \\( g \\)

is more precise than the average value of \\( 9\text{.}{\text{80 m/s}}^{2} \\)

; it represents the local value for the acceleration due to gravity.

A rescue helicopter is hovering over a person whose boat has sunk. One of the rescuers throws a life preserver straight down to the victim with an initial velocity of 1.40 m/s and observes that it takes 1.8 s to reach the water. (a) List the knowns in this problem. (b) How high above the water was the preserver released? Note that the downdraft of the helicopter reduces the effects of air resistance on the falling life preserver, so that an acceleration equal to that of gravity is reasonable.

A dolphin in an aquatic show jumps straight up out of the water at a velocity of 13.0 m/s. (a) List the knowns in this problem. (b) How high does his body rise above the water? To solve this part, first note that the final velocity is now a known and identify its value. Then identify the unknown, and discuss how you chose the appropriate equation to solve for it. After choosing the equation, show your steps in solving for the unknown, checking units, and discuss whether the answer is reasonable. (c) How long is the dolphin in the air? Neglect any effects due to his size or orientation.

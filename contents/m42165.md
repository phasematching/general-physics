In the previous two sections, we considered only one-dimensional collisions;
during such collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the
same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in
which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and we
shall see that their study is an extension of the one-dimensional analysis
already presented. The approach taken (similar to the approach in discussing
two-dimensional kinematics and dynamics) is to choose a convenient coordinate
system and resolve the motion into components along perpendicular axes.
Resolving the motion yields a pair of one-dimensional problems to be solved
simultaneously.

One complication arising in two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might
rotate before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook
arms as they pass by one another, they will spin in circles. We will not
consider such rotation until later, and so for now we arrange things so that no
rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of 
**point masses**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1362764}â€”that is, structureless
particles that cannot rotate or spin.

We start by assuming that $$ \vb{F}_{\text{net}}=0 $$, so that momentum $$
\vb{p} $$ is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the
particles is initially at rest. (
See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747387).) The best choice for a coordinate system
is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747387). Because momentum is conserved, the
components of momentum along the $$ x $$- and $$ y $$-axes 
$$ \left( p_{x}\text{ and } p_{y}\right) $$ will also be
  conserved, but with the chosen coordinate system, $$ p_{y} $$ is initially
  zero and $$ p_{x} $$ is the momentum of the incoming particle. Both facts
  simplify the analysis. (   Even with the simplifying assumptions of point masses, 
  one particle initially
  at rest, and a convenient coordinate system, we still gain new insights into
  nature from the analysis of two-dimensional collisions.)

![A purple ball of mass m1 moves with velocity V 1 toward the right side along the X direction. The orange ball of mass m 2 is initially at rest. The total momentum is the momentum possessed by purple ball only. After collision purple ball moves with velocity v 1prime in the positive X Y plane making an angle theta 1 with the x axis and the orange ball moves in the X Y plane below the x axis making an angle theta 2 with the x axis. The total momentum would be the sum of the momentum of purple ball p1 prime and the orange ball p 2 prime. In two-dimensional collision too the momentum before and after collision remains the same.](../resources/Figure_09_06_02a.jpg "A two-dimensional collision with the coordinate system chosen so that \( m_2 \)  is initially at rest and \( v_1 \)  is parallel to the \( x \)  -axis.

Along the $$ x $$ -axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-854">
 $$ p_{1x}+ p_{2x}=p^{\prime}_{1x}+p^{\prime}_{2x}. $$ 
</div>

Where the subscripts denote the particles and axes and the primes denote the
situation after the collision. In terms of masses and velocities, this equation
is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-881">
 $$ m_{1} v_{1x}+ m_{2} v_{2x}= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1x}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2x}. $$ 
</div>

But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-166">
 $$ m_{1} v_{1x}= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1x}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2x}. $$ 
</div>

The components of the velocities along the $$ x $$ -axis have the form $$
v\cos{\theta} $$. Because particle 1 initially moves along the $$ x $$ -axis, we
find $$ v_{1x}= v_{1} $$.

Conservation of momentum along the $$ x $$ -axis gives the following equation:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-488">
 $$ m_{1} v_{1}= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1}\cos{\theta_{1}}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2}\cos{\theta_{2}}, $$ 
</div>

where $$\theta_{1} $$ and $$\theta_{2} $$ are as shown
in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747387).

Along the $$ y $$ -axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-742">
 $$ p_{1y}+ p_{2y}=p^{\prime}_{1y}+p^{\prime}_{2y} $$

 $$ m_{1} v_{1y}+ m_{2} v_{2y}= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1y}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2y}. $$ 
</div>

But $$ v_{1y} $$ is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along 
the $$ x $$ -axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest, $$ v_{2y} $$ is also zero. The
equation for conservation of momentum along the $$ y $$ -axis becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-10">
 $$ 0= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1y}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2y}. $$ 
</div>

The components of the velocities along the $$ y $$ -axis have the form $$
v\sin{\theta} $$.

Thus, conservation of momentum along the $$ y $$ -axis gives the following
equation:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-545">
 $$ 0= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1}\sin{\theta_{1}}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2}\sin{\theta_{2}}. $$

The equations of conservation of momentum along the $$ x $$ -axis and $$ y $$ -axis
are very useful in analyzing two-dimensional collisions
of particles, where one is originally stationary (a common laboratory situation).
But two equations can only be used to find two unknowns, and so other data may
be necessary when collision experiments are used to explore nature at the
subatomic level.

<div data-type="title">
Determining the Final Velocity of an Unseen Object from the Scattering of Another Object
</div>
Suppose the following experiment is performed. A 0.250-kg object 
$$ \left( m_{1}\right) $$ is slid on a frictionless surface into a dark room, where it strikes an
initially stationary object with mass of 0.400 kg $$ \left( m_{2}\right) $$. 
The 0.250-kg object emerges from the room at an angle of $$ 45.0^\circ $$ with its incoming direction.

The speed of the 0.250-kg object is originally 2.00 m/s and is 1.50 m/s after
the collision. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity ($$ 
v^{\prime}_{2} $$ and $$\theta_{2} $$)  of the 0.400-kg object after the
collision.

**Strategy**

Momentum is conserved because the surface is frictionless. The coordinate system
shown in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747922) is one in which $$ m_{2} $$ is
originally at rest and the initial velocity is parallel to the $$ x $$ -axis, so
that conservation of momentum along the $$ x $$ - and $$ y $$ -axes is 
applicable.

Everything is known in these equations except $$ v^{\prime}_{2} $$ and $$\theta_
{2} $$, which are precisely the quantities we wish to find. We can find two
unknowns because we have two independent equations: the equations describing the
conservation of momentum in the $$ x $$- and $$ y $$ -directions.

**Solution**

Solving $$ m_{1} v_{1}= m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1}\cos{\theta }_{1}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_
{2}\cos{\theta }_{2} $$ for $$ v_{2}^{\prime }\cos{\theta_{2}} $$ and $$ 0= m_
{1}v^{\prime}_{1}\sin{\theta }_{1}+ m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2}\sin{\theta }_{2} $$ for
$$ v^{\prime}_{2}\sin{\theta }_{2} $$ and taking the ratio yields an equation (
in which $$ \theta_2 $$ is the only unknown quantity. Applying the identity $$
\left(\tan{\theta} =\frac{ \sin{\theta} }{\cos{\theta} }\right) $$, we obtain:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-329">
 $$ \tan{\theta_{2}}=\frac{ v^{\prime}_{1}\sin{\theta_{1}}}{ v^{\prime}_{1}\cos{\theta_{1}}- v_{1}}. $$ 
</div>
Entering known values into the previous equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-45">
 $$ \tan{\theta_{2}}=\frac{ \left(1.50 \ms \right)\left(0.7071\right)}{\left(1.50 \ms \right)\left(0.7071\right)-2.00 \ms }=-1.129. $$ 
</div>
Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-532">
 $$\theta_{2}={\tan}^{-1}\left(-1.129\right)=311.5^\circ \approx 312^\circ. $$ 
</div>
Angles are defined as positive in the counter clockwise direction, so this angle indicates that $$ m_{2} $$ is scattered to the right in [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747922), as expected (
this angle is in the fourth quadrant). Either equation for the $$ x $$- or 
$$ y $$-axis can now be used to solve for $$ v^{\prime}_{2} $$, but the latter
equation is easiest because it has fewer terms.

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-516">
 $$ v^{\prime}_{2}=-\frac{ m_{1}}{ m_{2}}v^{\prime}_{1}\frac{ \sin{\theta_{1}}}{\sin{\theta_{2}}} $$ 
</div>
Entering known values into this equation gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-497">
 $$ v^{\prime}_{2}=-\left(\frac{0.250\kg }{0.400\kg }\right)\left(1.50 \ms \right)\left(\frac{0.7071}{-0.7485}\right). $$ 
</div>
Thus,

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-721">
 $$ v^{\prime}_{2}=0.886 \ms . $$ 
</div>

**Discussion**

It is instructive to calculate the internal kinetic energy of this two-object
system before and after the collision. (
This calculation is left as an end-of-chapter problem.) If you do this
calculation, you will find that the internal kinetic energy is less after the
collision, and so the collision is inelastic. This type of result makes a
physicist want to explore the system further.

It collides with an object of mass m two of value zero point four zero milligrams which was initially at rest and then leaves the dark room from the top right hand side making an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizontal and at velocity v one prime. The net external force on the system is zero. The momentum before and after collision remains the same. The velocity v two prime of the mass m two and the angle theta two it would make with the horizontal after collision not given.](../resources/Figure_09_06_03a.jpg "A collision taking place in a dark room is explored in  [link]. The incoming object \( m_1 \)  is scattered by an initially stationary object. Only the stationary object&#x2019;s mass \( m_2 \)  is known.

### Elastic Collisions of Two Objects with Equal Mass

Some interesting situations arise when the two colliding objects have equal mass
and the collision is elastic. This situation is nearly the case with colliding
billiard balls, and precisely the case with some subatomic particle collisions.
We can thus get a mental image of a collision of subatomic particles by thinking
about billiards (or pool)
. (Refer to [\[link\]](#import-auto-id2747387) for masses and angles.) First, an
elastic collision conserves internal kinetic energy. Again, let us assume object
2 $$ \left( m_{2}\right) $$ is initially at rest. Then, the internal kinetic
energy before and after the collision of two objects that have equal masses is

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-213">
 $$ \frac{1}{2}m v_{1}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}{ m {v^{\prime}}_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}{ m {v^{\prime} }_{2}}^{2}. $$ 
</div>

Because the masses are equal, $$ m_{1}=m_{2}=m $$. Algebraic manipulation (left
to the reader) of conservation of momentum in the $$ x $$- and $$ y $$ -directions can show that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-717">
 $$ \frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}{ m {v^{\prime} }_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}{ m {v^{\prime} }_{2}}^{2}+{mv^{\prime} }_{1}v^{\prime}_{2}\cos\left({\theta_{1}}-{\theta_{2}}\right). $$ 
</div>

(Remember that $$\theta_{2} $$ is negative here.) The two preceding equations
can both be true only if

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-590">
 $$ mv^{\prime}_{1}v^{\prime}_{2}\cos\left({\theta_{1}}-{\theta_{2}}\right)=0. $$ 
</div>

There are three ways that this term can be zero. They are

* $$ v^{\prime}_{1}=0 $$: head-on collision; incoming ball stops

* $$ v^{\prime}_{2}=0 $$: no collision; incoming ball continues unaffected

* $$ \cos\left({\theta_{1}}-{\theta_{2}}\right)=0 $$: angle of separation $$
 \left({\theta_{1}}-{\theta_{2}}\right) $$ is $$ 90^\circ $$ after the
  collision {: data-bullet-style="bullet"}

All three of these ways are familiar occurrences in billiards and pool, although
most of us try to avoid the second. If you play enough pool, you will notice
that the angle between the balls is very close to $$ 90^\circ $$ after the
collision, although it will vary from this value if a great deal of spin is
placed on the ball. (Large spin carries in extra energy and a quantity called 
*angular momentum*, which must also be conserved.) The assumption that the
scattering of billiard balls is elastic is reasonable based on the correctness
of the three results it produces. This assumption also implies that, to a good
approximation, momentum is conserved for the two-ball system in billiards and
pool. The problems below explore these and other characteristics of
two-dimensional collisions.

### Section Summary

* The approach to two-dimensional collisions is to choose a convenient
  coordinate system and break the motion into components along perpendicular
  axes. Choose a coordinate system with the $$ x $$ -axis parallel to the
  velocity of the incoming particle.
* Two-dimensional collisions of point masses where mass 2 is initially at rest
  conserve momentum along the initial direction of mass 1 (the $$ x $$ -axis),
  stated by $$ m_{1} v_{1} = m_{1} v^{\prime}_{1} 
 \cos{\theta }_{1}+m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2} \cos{\theta }_{2} $$ and along the direction perpendicular
  to the initial direction (the $$ y $$ -axis) stated by $$ 0=
  m_{1}v^{\prime}_{1y}+m_{2}v^{\prime}_{2y} $$.
* The internal kinetic before and after the collision of two objects that have
  equal masses is

 $$ \frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}=

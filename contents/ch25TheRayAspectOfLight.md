* List the ways by which light travels from a source to another location.
</div>

There are three ways in which light can travel from a source to another
location. (See [[Figure 1]](#Figure1).) It can come directly from the source
through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Or light can travel through
various media, such as air and glass, to the person. Light can also arrive after
being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all of these cases, light is modeled as
traveling in straight lines called rays. Light may change direction when it
encounters objects (such as a mirror) or in passing from one material to
another (such as in passing from air to glass), but it then continues in a
straight line or as a ray. The word **ray** comes from mathematics and here
means a straight line that originates at some point. It is acceptable to
visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray
guns).

![](../resources/Figure_25_01_01.jpg "Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth traveling through empty space directly from the source. (b) Light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel through media like air and glass. It can also reflect from an object like a mirror. In the situations shown here, light interacts with objects large enough that it travels in straight lines, like a ray.")
{: #Figure1}

Experiments, as well as our own experiences, show that when light interacts with
objects several times as large as its wavelength, it travels in straight lines
and acts like a ray. Its wave characteristics are not pronounced in such
situations. Since the wavelength of light is less than a micron (a thousandth of
a millimeter), it acts like a ray in the many common situations in which it
encounters objects larger than a micron. For example, when light encounters
anything we can observe with unaided eyes, such as a mirror, it acts like a ray,
with only subtle wave characteristics. We will concentrate on the ray
characteristics in this chapter.

Since light moves in straight lines, changing directions when it interacts with
materials, it is described by geometry and simple trigonometry. This part of
optics, where the ray aspect of light dominates, is therefore called **geometric
optics**. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it
interacts with matter. These are the law of reflection, for situations in which
light bounces off matter, and the law of refraction, for situations in which
light passes through matter.

### Section Summary

* A straight line that originates at some point is called a ray.
* The part of optics dealing with the ray aspect of light is called geometric
  optics.
* Light can travel in three ways from a source to another location: (1) directly
  from the source through empty space; (2) through various media; (3) after
  being reflected from a mirror.

### Problems &amp; Exercises

<div class="exercise" data-element-type="problem-exercises">
<div class="problem" markdown="1">
Suppose a man stands in front of a mirror as shown in [[Figure 2]](#Figure2). His eyes are 1.65 m above the floor, and the top of his head is 0.13 m higher. Find the height above the floor of the top and bottom of the smallest mirror in which he can see both the top of his head and his feet. How is this distance related to the man’s height?

![A man standing in front of a mirror on a wall at a distance of several feet. The mirror&#x2019;s top is at eye level, but its bottom is only waist high. Arrows illustrate how the man can see his reflection from head to toe in the mirror.](../resources/Figure_25_02_07.jpg "A full-length mirror is one in which you can see all of yourself. It need not be as big as you, and its size is independent of your distance from it.")

<div class="solution" markdown="1">
Top  $$1.715 \text{m} $$
 from floor, bottom  $$0.825 \text{m} $$
 from floor. Height of mirror is  $$0.890 \text{m} $$ ,
 or precisely one-half the height of the person.

</div>

Anyone who has used a microwave oven knows there is energy in **electromagnetic waves**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737981077}. Sometimes this energy is obvious, such as in the warmth of the summer sun. Other times it is subtle, such as the unfelt energy of gamma rays, which can destroy living cells.

Electromagnetic waves can bring energy into a system by virtue of their **electric and magnetic fields**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169737796632}. These fields can exert forces and move charges in the system and, thus, do work on them. If the frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as the natural frequencies of the system (such as microwaves at the resonant frequency of water molecules), the transfer of energy is much more efficient.

Connections: Waves and Particles
</div>
The behavior of electromagnetic radiation clearly exhibits wave characteristics. But we shall find in later modules that at high frequencies, electromagnetic radiation also exhibits particle characteristics. These particle characteristics will be used to explain more of the properties of the electromagnetic spectrum and to introduce the formal study of modern physics.

Another startling discovery of modern physics is that particles, such as electrons and protons, exhibit wave characteristics. This simultaneous sharing of wave and particle properties for all submicroscopic entities is one of the great symmetries in nature.

</div>

 ![The propagation of two electromagnetic waves is shown in three dimensional planes. The first wave shows with the variation of two components E and B. E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the vibrations of particles in the plane. B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the E wave. The B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because E and B are perpendicular to each other. The direction of propagation of wave is shown perpendicular to E and B waves. The energy carried is given as E sub u. The second wave shows with the variation of the components two E and two B, that is, E and B waves with double the amplitude of the first case. Two E is a sine wave in one plane with small arrows showing the vibrations of particles in the plane. Two B is a sine wave in a plane perpendicular to the two E wave. The two B wave has arrows to show the vibrations of particles in the plane. The waves are shown intersecting each other at the junction of the planes because two E and two B waves are perpendicular to each other. The direction of propagation of wave is shown perpendicular to two E and two B waves. The energy carried is given as four E sub u.](../resources/Figure 25_04_01a.jpg "Energy carried by a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. With electromagnetic waves, larger E size 12{E} {}-fields and B size 12{B} {}-fields exert larger forces and can do more work."){: #import-auto-id1169737999600}

But there is energy in an electromagnetic wave, whether it is absorbed or not. Once created, the fields carry energy away from a source. If absorbed, the field strengths are diminished and anything left travels on. Clearly, the larger the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, the more work they can do and the greater the energy the electromagnetic wave carries.

A wave’s energy is proportional to its **amplitude**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738257229} squared ($${E}^{2}$$

 or $${B}^{2}$$

). This is true for waves on guitar strings, for water waves, and for sound waves, where amplitude is proportional to pressure. In electromagnetic waves, the amplitude is the **maximum field strength**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738045300} of the electric and magnetic fields. (See [\[link\]](#import-auto-id1169737999600).)

Thus the energy carried and the **intensity**{: data-type="term" #import-auto-id1169738037095} $$I$$

 of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to $${E}^{2}$$

 and $${B}^{2}$$

. In fact, for a continuous sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, the average intensity $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$

 is given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-267">
$${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\mathrm{c\epsilon }}_{0}{E}_{0}^{2}}{2},$$
</div>

where $$c$$

 is the speed of light, $${\epsilon }_{0}$$

 is the permittivity of free space, and $${E}_{0}$$

 is the maximum electric field strength; intensity, as always, is power per unit area (here in $${\text{W/m}}^{2}$$

).

The average intensity of an electromagnetic wave $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$

 can also be expressed in terms of the magnetic field strength by using the relationship $$B=E/c$$

, and the fact that $${\epsilon }_{0}=1/{\mu }_{0}{c}^{2}$$

, where $${\mu }_{0}$$

 is the permeability of free space. Algebraic manipulation produces the relationship

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-657">
$${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\text{cB}}_{0}^{2}}{ {2\mu }_{0}},$$
</div>

where $${B}_{0}$$

 is the maximum magnetic field strength.

One more expression for $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$

 in terms of both electric and magnetic field strengths is useful. Substituting the fact that $$c\cdot {B}_{0}={E}_{0}$$

, the previous expression becomes

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-514">
$${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {E}_{0}{B}_{0}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}.$$
</div>

Whichever of the three preceding equations is most convenient can be used, since they are really just different versions of the same principle: Energy in a wave is related to amplitude squared. Furthermore, since these equations are based on the assumption that the electromagnetic waves are sinusoidal, peak intensity is twice the average; that is, $${I}_{0}=2{I}_{\text{ave}}$$

.

Calculate Microwave Intensities and Fields
</div>
On its highest power setting, a certain microwave oven projects 1.00 kW of microwaves onto a 30.0 by 40.0 cm area. (a) What is the intensity in $${\text{W/m}}^{2}$$

? (b) Calculate the peak electric field strength $${E}_{0}$$

 in these waves. (c) What is the peak magnetic field strength $${B}_{0}$$

?

**Strategy**

In part (a), we can find intensity from its definition as power per unit area. Once the intensity is known, we can use the equations below to find the field strengths asked for in parts (b) and (c).

**Solution for (a)**

Entering the given power into the definition of intensity, and noting the area is 0.300 by 0.400 m, yields

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-585">
$$I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{1\text{.}\text{00 kW}}{0\text{.}\text{300 m}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}×\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}0\text{.}\text{400 m}}.$$
</div>
Here $$I={I}_{\text{ave}}$$

, so that

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-255">
$${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{\text{1000 W}}{0\text{.}\text{120}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}{\text{m}}^{2}}=8\text{.}\text{33}×{\text{10}}^{3}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}{\text{W/m}}^{2}.$$
</div>
Note that the peak intensity is twice the average:

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-213">
$${I}_{0}=2{I}_{\text{ave}}=1\text{.}\text{67}×{\text{10}}^{4}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{W}/{\text{m}}^{2}.$$
</div>
**Solution for (b)**

To find $${E}_{0}$$

, we can rearrange the first equation given above for $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$

 to give

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-141">
$${E}_{0}={\left(\frac{2{I}_{\text{ave}}}{ {\mathrm{c\epsilon }}_{0}}\right)}^{1/2}.$$
</div>
Entering known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-261">
$$\begin{array}{lll}{E}_{0}& =& \sqrt{\frac{2\left(8\text{.}\text{33}×{\text{10}}^{3}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}{\text{W/m}}^{2}\right)}{\left(3\text{.}\text{00}×{\text{10}}^{8}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{m/s}\right)\left(8.85×{\text{10}}^{–12}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}{\text{C}}^{2}/\text{N}\cdot {\text{m}}^{2}\right)}}\\ & =& 2.51×{\text{10}}^{3}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}\text{.}\end{array}$$
</div>
**Solution for (c)**

Perhaps the easiest way to find magnetic field strength, now that the electric field strength is known, is to use the relationship given by

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-388">
$${B}_{0}=\frac{ {E}_{0}}{c}.$$
</div>
Entering known values gives

<div data-type="equation" id="eip-16">
$$\begin{array}{lll}{B}_{0}& =& \frac{2.51×{\text{10}}^{3}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{V/m}}{3.0×{\text{10}}^{8}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{m/s}}\\ & =& 8.35×{\text{10}}^{-6}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}\text{T}\text{.}\end{array}$$
</div>
**Discussion**

As before, a relatively strong electric field is accompanied by a relatively weak magnetic field in an electromagnetic wave, since $$B=E/c$$

, and $$c$$

 is a large number.

### Section Summary

* {: #import-auto-id1169737923902} The energy carried by any wave is proportional to its amplitude squared. For electromagnetic waves, this means intensity can be expressed as
  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-612">
  $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\mathrm{c\epsilon }}_{0}{E}_{0}^{2}}{2},$$
  </div>
  
  where $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$
  
   is the average intensity in $${\text{W/m}}^{2}$$
  
  , and $${E}_{0}$$
  
   is the maximum electric field strength of a continuous sinusoidal wave.

* {: #import-auto-id1169737909839} This can also be expressed in terms of the maximum magnetic field strength
  $${B}_{0}$$
  
  as
  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-578">
  $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {\text{cB}}_{0}^{2}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}$$
  </div>
  
  and in terms of both electric and magnetic fields as
  
  <div data-type="equation" id="eip-681">
  $${I}_{\text{ave}}=\frac{ {E}_{0}{B}_{0}}{ {2\mu }_{0}}.$$
  </div>

* {: #import-auto-id1169737794478} The three expressions for
  $${I}_{\text{ave}}$$
  
  are all equivalent.

**Unreasonable Results**

An $$\text{LC}$$

 circuit containing a 1.00-pF capacitor oscillates at such a frequency that it radiates at a 300-nm wavelength. (a) What is the inductance of the circuit? (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which assumptions are unreasonable or inconsistent?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" data-element-type="problems-exercises" markdown="1">
(a) $$2\text{.}\text{53}×{\text{10}}^{-\text{20}}\phantom{\rule{0.25em}{0ex}}H$$

(b) L is much too small.

(c) The wavelength is unreasonably small.

**Create Your Own Problem**

Consider electromagnetic fields produced by high voltage power lines. Construct a problem in which you calculate the intensity of this electromagnetic radiation in $${\text{W/m}}^{2}$$

 based on the measured magnetic field strength of the radiation in a home near the power lines. Assume these magnetic field strengths are known to average less than a $$\mu T$$

. The intensity is small enough that it is difficult to imagine mechanisms for biological damage due to it. Discuss how much energy may be radiating from a section of power line several hundred meters long and compare this to the power likely to be carried by the lines. An idea of how much power this is can be obtained by calculating the approximate current responsible for $$\mu T$$

 fields at distances of tens of meters.

**Create Your Own Problem**

Consider the most recent generation of residential satellite dishes that are a little less than half a meter in diameter. Construct a problem in which you calculate the power received by the dish and the maximum electric field strength of the microwave signals for a single channel received by the dish. Among the things to be considered are the power broadcast by the satellite and the area over which the power is spread, as well as the area of the receiving dish.
